AN EMBODIMENT ACCOUNTING MODEL IS DEVELOPED, WHICH TAKES FULL ACCOUNT OF VIRTUAL WATER FEEDBACKS RELATED TO PRIMARY INPUTS. GLOBAL TOTAL TRADE VOLUME OF VIRTUAL WATER IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN MAGNITUDE AROUND 30\% OF THE GLOBAL DIRECT FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL. MOREOVER, IT IS REVEALED THAT GLOBAL VIRTUAL WATER TRANSFER IN INTERMEDIATE TRADE IS IN MAGNITUDE AROUND 1.4 TIMES THAT IN FINAL TRADE. IN INTERMEDIATE TRADE OF VIRTUAL WATER, CHINA, JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM TURN OUT TO BE THE THREE LEADING NET IMPORTERS, WHILE INDIA, RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE REVEALED AS THE LEADING NET EXPORTERS. IN FINAL TRADE OF VIRTUAL WATER, THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND RUSSIA ARE THE MAJOR NET IMPORTERS, IN CONTRAST TO CHINA, INDIA AND MEXICO AS THE LEADING NET EXPORTERS. TRADE CONNECTIONS AND IMBALANCES OF MAJOR ECONOMIES IN TERMS OF VIRTUAL WATER ARE QUANTIFIED AND ANALYZED. TWO NEW INDICATORS IN TERMS OF WATER SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATE BY SOURCE AND THAT BY SINK ARE DEVISED. IT IS FOUND THAT AROUND 40\% OF THE USE OF CHINA'S FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL FINALLY SINKS INTO FOREIGN ECONOMIES WHILE ONLY 20\% OF CHINA'S VIRTUAL WATER USE ORIGINATES FROM OTHER REGIONS. WITH REGARD TO GERMANY, CANADA AND FRANCE, THEY BEHAVE LIKE ACTIVE PUMPS DRIVING VAST VIRTUAL WATER INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS, DEMONSTRATING THEIR HIGH INVOLVEMENT IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN IN TERMS OF VIRTUAL WATER. WITH THE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT VIRTUAL WATER TRANSFER WITHIN THE WORLD ECONOMY, NATIONS AND REGIONS OUGHT TO ASSESS THEIR BEHAVIORS IN INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES OF VIRTUAL WATER FOR SUSTAINABLE USE OF FRESHWATER RESOURCES.",""

DUE TO ITS COMPLEX BOTTOM TOPOGRAPHY, ALTERNATING MONSOON FORCING AND CONJUNCTION OF SEVERAL CURRENT SYSTEMS [SUCH AS THE ZHEJIANG-FUJIAN (ZHE-MIN) COASTAL CURRENT, THE KUROSHIO INTRUSION AND THE EXTENSION OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WARM CURRENT], THE PHYSICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH IN SPACE AND IN TIME. OUR RECENT INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES, COMBINING IN SITU AND REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS WITH NUMERICAL MODELING, ALLOW US TO ADDRESS SEVERAL IMPORTANT ISSUES CONCERNING THE TAIWAN STRAIT. THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF CIRCULATION IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT IS MODULATED BY STRONG MONSOON FORCING, COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHY AND CIRCULATION IN THE NORTHERN SOUTH CHINA SEA AS WELL AS COASTAL WATER INPUT AND THE KUROSHIO INTRUSION. THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES OF CARBON AND NUTRIENTS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT DEPEND LARGELY ON THE PHYSICAL FORCING (EXTERNAL INPUT) AND THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE (INTERNAL CYCLING). THE PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT ARE DOMINATED BY NANO- AND PICO-PHYTOPLANKTON, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MICROBIAL FOOD WEB TO THE TRADITIONAL FOOD WEB IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 30\%, IMPLYING THE FUNDAMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MICROBIAL FOOD WEB IN THIS SUBTROPICAL REGION. UPWELLING IS A PREDOMINANT FEATURE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT AND SHOWS DYNAMIC SHORT-TERM, SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS. COMBINED HYDROGRAPHIC AND SATELLITE-DERIVED INFORMATION PROVIDES EVIDENCE ON THE TELECONNECTION BETWEEN THE TAIWAN STRAIT UPWELLING VARIATION AND THE EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO) CLIMATE VARIABILITY. UPWELLING HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES, BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY AND ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE. NOT ONLY THE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY, BUT ALSO DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE REVEAL THE DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO THE VARIATIONS IN UPWELLING, WHICH SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FISHERY RESOURCES. IN THIS OVERVIEW. WE SUMMARIZE THE HYDROGRAPHICAL FEATURES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON UPWELLING, WHICH IS THE KEY DRIVER OF BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT.

UNLIKE MOST STUDIES DONE IN THE PAST 25 YEARS ON SIMILAR TOPICS, THE STUDIES REVIEWED HERE COVERED A BROAD SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BEYOND JUST ENERGY USE OR CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS. THE STUDIES DIFFERED GREATLY IN BASIC APPROACH (EXTRAPOLATING LCA DATA TO IMPACTS OF CONSUMPTION CATEGORIES VERSUS APPROACHES BASED ON ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT (EEIO) TABLES), GEOGRAPHICAL REGION, DISAGGREGATION OF FINAL DEMAND, DATA INVENTORY USED, AND METHOD OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT.

THE SUMMER MONSOON SYSTEM OVER EAST ASIA (INCLUDING THE SOUTH CHINA SEA (SCS)) CANNOT BE JUST THOUGHT OF AS THE EASTWARD AND NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE INDIAN MONSOON. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THE HUGE ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON SYSTEM CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO SUBSYSTEMS: THE INDIAN AND THE EAST ASIAN MONSOON SYSTEM WHICH ARE TO A GREATER EXTENT INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE MAJOR FINDINGS MADE IN RECENT TWO DECADES ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW: (1) THE EARLIEST ONSET OF THE ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON OCCURS IN MOST OF CASES IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN INDOCHINA PENINSULA. THE ONSET IS PRECEDED BY DEVELOPMENT OF A BOB (BAY OF BENGAL) CYCLONE, THE RAPID ACCELERATION OF LOW-LEVEL WESTERLIES AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN BOTH AREAL EXTENT AND INTENSITY IN THE TROPICAL EAST INDIAN OCEAN AND THE BAY OF BENGAL. (2) THE SEASONAL MATCH OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON DISPLAYS A DISTINCT STEPWISE NORTHWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD ADVANCE, WITH TWO ABRUPT NORTHWARD JUMPS AND THREE STATIONARY PERIODS. THE MONSOON RAIN COMMENCES OVER THE REGION FROM THE INDOCHINA PENINSULA-THE SCS-PHILIPPINES DURING THE PERIOD FROM EARLY MAY TO MID-MAY, THEN IT EXTENDS ABRUPTLY TO THE YANGTZE RIVER BASIN, AND WESTERN AND SOUTHERN JAPAN, AND THE SOUTHWESTERN PHILIPPINE SEA IN EARLY TO MID-JUNE AND FINALLY PENETRATES TO NORTH CHINA, KOREA AND PART OF JAPAN, AND THE TOPICAL WESTERN WEST PACIFIC. (3) AFTER THE ONSET OF THE ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON, THE MOISTURE TRANSPORT COMING FROM INDOCHINA PENINSULA AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA PLAYS A CRUCIAL ``SWITCH'' ROLE IN MOISTURE SUPPLY FOR PRECIPITATION IN EAST ASIA, THUS LEADING TO A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN CLIMATE REGIME IN EAST ASIA AND EVEN MORE REMOTE AREAS THROUGH TELECONNECTION. (4) THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON AND RELATED SEASONAL RAIN BELTS ASSUMES SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY AT INTRASEASONAL, INTERANNUAL AND INTERDECADAL TIME SCALES. THEIR INTERACTION, I.E., PHASE LOCKING AND IN-PHASE OR OUT-PHASE SUPERIMPOSING, CAN TO A GREATER EXTENT CONTROL THE BEHAVIORS OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON AND PRODUCE UNIQUE RYTHEM AND SINGULARITIES. (5) TWO EXTERNAL FORCING I.E., PACIFIC AND INDIAN OCEAN SSTS AND THE SNOW COVER IN THE EURASIA AND THE TIBETAN PLATEAU, ARE BELIEVED TO BE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON. HOWEVER, THE INTERNAL VARIABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. IN PARTICULAR, THE BLOCKING HIGHS IN MID-AND HIGH LATITUDES OF EURASIAN CONTINENTS AND THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH OVER THE WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FRONT THE CONDITION FOR THE SOUTH ASIAN MONSOON. THE LATER IS OF TROPICAL MONSOON NATURE WHILE THE FORMER IS OF HYBRID NATURE OF TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL MONSOON WITH INTENSE IMPACT FROM MID-AND HIGH LATITUDES.",""

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH FOUR WELL-KNOWN APPROACHES TO ANALYSIS OF COST OF CORROSION VIZ., THE UHLIG METHOD, THE HOAR METHOD, NBS-BCL INPUT/OUTPUT METHOD AND NET PRESENT VALUE METHOD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN GREAT DETAIL AND THE IMPACT OF THESE APPROACHES ON CORROSION ECONOMY IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. FINDINGS UHLIG METHOD OF ESTIMATING CORROSION COST ALWAYS GIVES A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF THE DIRECT COST OF CORROSION. THE DIRECT COST OF CORROSION, AS ESTIMATED BY THE HOAR METHOD, IS FOUND TO BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN IS THE ESTIMATE MADE USING THE UHLIG METHOD, AS SHOWN BY SHIBATA OF JAPAN. THE NBS-BCL METHOD OF INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS, THOUGH APPARENTLY MORE SCIENTIFIC, IS SUBJECT ULTIMATELY TO UNCERTAINTIES IN QUANTIFYING THE CAPITAL COST AND INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT. THE NET PRESENT VALUE METHOD APPEARS TO BE MORE REALISTIC THAN DO OTHER APPROACHES AS IT ENABLES A LIFE CYCLE COSTING OF EACH STRUCTURE/FACILITY TO BE MADE AND ARRIVES AT THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE CORROSION CONTROL METHOD. EVEN THOUGH ALL THE ABOVE FOUR APPROACHES ENABLE AN ESTIMATION OF DIRECT COST OF CORROSION, THERE IS NO STANDARD APPROACH TO ASSESS THE INDIRECT COST OF CORROSION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE IN A DEVELOPING ECONOMY, EACH AND EVERY INDUSTRY HAS TO GO FOR SYSTEMATIC CORROSION AUDITING IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND ADOPT THE MOST APPROPRIATE CORROSION CONTROL MEASURES AND EFFECT CONSIDERABLE SAVINGS.

DURING THIS TIME IT WAS IN PHASE WITH THE 11-YEAR SUNSPOT CYCLE. THE CORRELATION WITH THE SOLAR CYCLE IS POSITIVE AND LARGEST IN THE STRATOSPHERIC GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHTS OF THE SUBTROPICS BELOW 10 MBAR (APPROXIMATELY 31 KM, WHICH IS AS HIGH AS THE GRID POINT DATA REACH), ESPECIALLY ON THE WESTERN, OCEAN-DOMINATED SIDE OF THE HEMISPHERE. AS EXPECTED FROM THE HYDROSTATIC EQUATION, IT IS ALSO EVIDENT IN THE TEMPERATURES OF THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE IN THE SAME REGION. THERE IS NO LARGE CORRELATION AT HIGH LATITUDES. THE CORRELATION WITH THE SUNSPOT CYCLE IS WEAKEST IN JANUARY-FEBRUARY, BUT IF THE DATA IN THESE MONTHS ARE GROUPED ACCORDING TO THE WIND DIRECTION IN THE QUASI-BIENNIAL OSCILLATION (QBO) OF THE LOWER EQUATORIAL STRATOSPHERE, THE POSITIVE SUBTROPICAL CORRELATIONS IN THE EAST YEARS ARE AS HIGH AS IN ALL OTHER MONTHS. THERE ARE, IN ADDITION LARGE NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS IN THE ARCTIC IN AGREEMENT WITH THE STRONG TELECONNECTION (NEGATIVE CORRELATION) BETWEEN LOWER AND HIGHER LATITUDES IN WINTER. THERE IS NO CONSISTENT SIGN IN THE WEAK CORRELATIONS AT MIDDLE AND LOWER LATITUDES IN THE WEST YEARS, BUT IN THE ARCTIC THE CORRELATION WITH THE SOLAR CYCLE IS HIGHLY POSITIVE, BECAUSE THOSE MAJOR MIDWINTER WARMINGS THAT OCCUR IN WEST YEARS OF THE QBO TAKE PLACE IN SOLAR MAXIMA, WHEREAS THE YEARS WITHOUT MAJOR WARMINGS ARE FOUND IN SOLAR MINIMA.

THIS PAPER SYNTHESIZES RESULTS OF PUBLISHED MODELING STUDIES THAT EXAMINED THE GROUNDWATER SYSTEM AND HYDROLOGIC CYCLE UNDER THE REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP) 8.5 SCENARIO (CO2 AT 936-PPM LEVEL AT YEAR 2100). NATURAL REPLENISHMENT OF GROUNDWATER OCCURS PREDOMINANTLY FROM INFILTRATION OF PRECIPITATION AND SURFACE IMPOUNDMENTS. THEREFORE, THE FIRST STAGE OF THE STUDY WAS TO REVIEW A CHANGED HYDROLOGIC CYCLE UNDER RCP 8.5 IN TERMS OF INFLUENCE FROM (1) PRECIPITATION, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, AND SOIL MOISTURE; (2) SURFACE WATER AND ITS INTERACTION WITH GROUNDWATER; (3) EXTREME HYDROLOGIC EVENTS, AND (4) TELECONNECTION PATTERNS. THE GENERAL PATTERN OF CLIMATE IMPACT ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES FOLLOWS THE PRECIPITATION PATTERN WITH DEPLETION IN TROPICAL AND/OR SUBTROPICAL REGIONS AND WITH INCREASE IN THE HIGH-LATITUDE REGIONS OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES. HOWEVER, REGIONAL VARIABILITY ALSO CORRESPONDS TO THE HETEROGENOUS IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGES ON REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF PRECIPITATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, LOCALIZED INTERACTION BETWEEN SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER, AND DISTANCES FROM THE OCEANS WITH RISING SEA LEVEL. THE DECLINE OF THE WATER TABLE IN MANY AREAS MAY SERIOUSLY REDUCE IRRIGATED CROP PRODUCTION AND ADVERSELY IMPACT GROUNDWATER-DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS. RELATIVELY FEWER STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES COMPARED TO SURFACE-WATER SYSTEMS, AND THE UNCERTAINTIES ON THE RECHARGE ESTIMATES ARE LARGE. THERE APPEARS TO BE AN URGENT NEED FOR INCLUDING GROUNDWATER SYSTEMS IN CLIMATE IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND IN CLIMATE MITIGATION STRATEGIES.",""

NATURAL GAS EMBODIED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS REVEALED AMOUNTING TO 2722.1 BCM, IN MAGNITUDE UP TO 90\% OF TOTAL GAS EXTRACTION FOR ENERGY USE, INDICATING THE INTENSIVE RELOCATION OF GAS USE BY TRADE. 83\% OF TRADED EMBODIED NATURAL GAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERMEDIATE TRADE, MAINLY FROM LEADING PRIMARY SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING RUSSIA, USA AND WESTERN ASIA, TO DOMINANT FINAL CONSUMERS, LIKE USA, EU27 AND EAST ASIA. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ARE FOUND BETWEEN DIRECT AND EMBODIED NATURAL GAS FLOWS. CONSUMPTION-BASED RESOURCE EFFICIENCY CAN BREAK THE ILLUSION OF EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS, AND TRADE IMBALANCE IN TERMS OF GAS USE CAN BE OPPOSITE TO THE TRADE IMBALANCE IN CONVENTIONAL MONETARY TERMS.

THESE ACCOUNTS FACE CHALLENGES IN TWO MAIN AREAS: (1) THE ALLOCATION OF LAND TO PRODUCTS TRADED AND CONSUMED AND (2) THE METRICS TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES IN LAND QUALITY AND LAND-USE INTENSITY. FOR TWO MAIN FAMILIES OF ACCOUNTING APPROACHES (BIOPHYSICAL, FACTOR-BASED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS), THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES AND COMPARES RESULTS FOR LAND FOOTPRINTS. BIOPHYSICAL APPROACHES ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE A LARGE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND DIFFERENT LAND USES, BUT SUFFER FROM A TRUNCATION PROBLEM. ECONOMIC APPROACHES SOLVE THE TRUNCATION PROBLEM, BUT ARE HAMPERED BY THE LIMITED DISAGGREGATION OF SECTORS AND PRODUCTS. IN LIGHT OF THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES, THE OVERALL SIMILARITY OF RESULTS GENERATED BY BOTH TYPES OF APPROACHES IS REMARKABLE. DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED RESULTS FOR SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF BIOMASS-BASED PRODUCTS, HOWEVER, MAKE INTERPRETATION DIFFICULT. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO PROVIDE CLARITY ON SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTUAL ISSUES OF ACCOUNTING FOR LAND FOOTPRINTS.",""

IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LIVING STANDARDS IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE ACCELERATING DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR ECONOMIES HAS RESULTED IN A DISPROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THEREFORE, A MAJOR REDUCTION IN HOUSEHOLD CARBON EMISSIONS (HCES) IS ESSENTIAL IF GLOBAL CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS ARE TO BE MET. TO DO THIS, MAJOR ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) STATES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED POLICIES TO ALLEVIATE THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIORS AND LESS CARBON-INTENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO PROPOSED TO PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY FURTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS CAN BE CONTEMPLATED, THOUGH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL CAUSES OF SUCH LARGE HCES AND HELP RESEARCHERS BOTH GAIN DEEP INSIGHTS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESEARCH DOMAIN AND IDENTIFY VALUABLE RESEARCH TOPICS FOR FUTURE STUDY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS EXISTING LITERATURE FOCUSING ON THE DOMAIN OF HCES. THIS CRITICAL REVIEW PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT WORK IN THE FIELD, DESCRIBING THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HCES UNDER THE THEMES OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME, HOUSEHOLD SIZE, AGE, EDUCATION LEVEL, LOCATION, GENDER AND REBOUND EFFECTS. THE MAIN QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGIES OF INPUT-OUTPUT MODELS, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND EMISSION COEFFICIENT METHODS ARE ALSO PRESENTED, AND THE PROPOSED MEASURES TO MITIGATE HCES AT THE POLICY, TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER LEVELS. FINALLY, THE LIMITATIONS OF WORK DONE TO DATE AND FURTHER RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR THE BENEFIT OF FUTURE STUDIES. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

STUDIES OF THE GLOBAL BIOMASS METABOLISM INVESTIGATE PHYSICAL FLOWS BETWEEN AND WITHIN NATURE AND HUMAN SYSTEMS, THUS PROVIDING A USEFUL BASIS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF CHANGES IN ONE PLACE WITH IMPACTS ELSEWHERE. VARIOUS METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES EXIST FOR STUDYING THE HUMAN-NATURE METABOLISM AND ESTIMATING THE LAND EMBODIED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE FLOWS, A CORE ELEMENT OF ASSESSING TELECOUPLINGS IN THE GLOBAL LAND SYSTEM. THE RESULTS OF RECENT STUDIES VARY WIDELY, LACKING ROBUSTNESS AND THUS HAMPERING THEIR APPLICATION IN POLICY MAKING. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A STRUCTURED OVERVIEW AND COMPARATIVE EVALUATION OF EXISTING ACCOUNTING METHODS AND MODELS FOR CALCULATING LAND FOOTPRINTS. WE IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN AVAILABLE ACCOUNTING METHODS AND INDICATE THEIR SHORTCOMINGS, WHICH ARE MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PRODUCT AND SUPPLY CHAIN COVERAGE AND DETAIL, AND BIASES INTRODUCED BY THE USE OF MONETARY FLOWS AS A PROXY FOR ACTUAL PHYSICAL FLOWS. WE SUGGEST OPTIONS FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL LAND FOOTPRINT ACCOUNTING METHODS, PARTICULARLY HIGHLIGHTING THE ADVANTAGES OF HYBRID ACCOUNTING APPROACHES AS A FRAMEWORK FOR ROBUST AND TRANSPARENT ASSESSMENTS OF THE GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT OF LAND USE.

EVEN THOUGH ALL RING-WIDTH RECORDS DESCRIBE THE SAME ASPECT OF TREE GROWTH, THERE ARE MAJOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE NATURE AND CLARITY OF CLIMATE INFORMATION PRESERVED WITHIN THESE DATA ACROSS THE HEMISPHERE. IN NORTH AMERICA, MANY CHRONOLOGIES RECORD CLIMATE VARIABILITY DURING THE GROWING SEASON BUT WINTER PRECIPITATION ALSO EXERTS A CONSIDERABLE AND SOMETIMES DOMINANT CONTROL ON TREE-RING FORMATION. ALMOST ALL RING-WIDTH RECORDS FROM EUROPE AND ASIA REFLECT THE INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE DURING SUMMER, WITH THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE BEING MORE PROMINENT THAN PRECIPITATION. MAPPING TELECONNECTION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR CLIMATE MODES SHOW THAT ENSO AND THE AMO HAVE STRONGER AND MORE CONSISTENT EFFECTS ON TREE GROWTH THAN DO THE PDO, PNA, AND NAO. THE ENSO TELECONNECTION, WHICH SEEMS TO BE COMMUNICATED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ITS EFFECT ON WINTER PRECIPITATION, IS EVIDENT WITHIN THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF RING-WIDTH RECORDS OVERALL AND IS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA. THE AMO'S EXPRESSION IN RING WIDTH IS CONSISTENT ACROSS DROUGHT SENSITIVE-RECORDS FROM THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST AND CENTRAL ROCKY MOUNTAINS, WHICH MAY REFLECT ITS INFLUENCE ON MOISTURE FLUX INTO THE WESTERN INTERIOR OF NORTH AMERICA DURING SUMMER. IN COMPARISON, THE RING-WIDTH RESPONSES TO THE PDO, PNA, AND NAO ARE LESS SPATIALLY COHERENT ACROSS THE NETWORK AND APPEAR BE CONNECTED THROUGH A MORE COMPLEX CHAIN OF CAUSES LINKING CLIMATE MODES, LOCAL CLIMATE AND SEASONAL TREE GROWTH. BECAUSE THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE RING-WIDTH NETWORK IS NOW SO LARGE, IT IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER TO ENSURE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TREE ENVIRONMENT RELATIONS IS NOT INFLUENCED BY DECISIONS TO INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE CERTAIN RECORDS. AS AN INITIAL STEP, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF PALEOCLIMATE RECONSTRUCTIONS DERIVED FROM TREE RINGS DESCRIBED MORE EXPLICITLY THE CRITERIA USED TO SELECT RING-WIDTH RECORDS AS POTENTIAL PREDICTORS AND SPECIFIED THOSE RECORDS EXCLUDED BY THAT SCREENING.

DESPITE WIDESPREAD ENTHUSIASM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF WATER FOOTPRINTS, SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE CONCEPT AND ITS USEFULNESS. A VARIETY OF METHODOLOGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR WATER FOOTPRINTING WHICH DIFFER WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY DEAL WITH DIFFERENT FORMS OF WATER USE. THE RESULT IS WATER FOOTPRINT ESTIMATES WHICH VARY DRAMATICALLY, OFTEN CREATING CONFUSION. DESPITE THESE METHODOLOGICAL QUALMS, THE CONCEPT HAS HAD NOTABLE SUCCESS IN RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT WATER USE IN AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CHAINS, BY PROVIDING A PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE AND (SEEMINGLY) SIMPLE NUMERICAL INDICATOR OF WATER USE. NEVERTHELESS, AND EVEN THOUGH A RANGE OF USES HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUGGESTED FOR WATER FOOTPRINTING, ITS POLICY VALUE REMAINS UNCLEAR. UNLIKE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT WHICH PROVIDES A UNIVERSAL MEASURE OF HUMAN IMPACT ON THE ATMOSPHERE'S LIMITED ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY, THE WATER FOOTPRINT IN ITS CONVENTIONAL FORM SOLELY QUANTIFIES A SINGLE PRODUCTION INPUT WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTING OF THE IMPACTS OF USE, WHICH VARY SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY.

LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT FACTORS MUST BE CONSIDERED TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO THE LIVESTOCK FARMING ``CRISIS'' IN EUROPE AND TO ASSESS THE ROOM TO MANOEUVRE OF PUBLIC POLICIES TO ADAPT THIS SECTOR TO THE DIVERSE CHALLENGES FACING IT. WE HAVE CONDUCTED A REVIEW TO ASSESS THE COMBINED EFFECTS ON RUMINANT LIVESTOCK EMPLOYMENT AND FAMERS' WORK AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL. IN THE FIRST SECTION, EMPLOYMENT IN RUMINANT LIVESTOCK FARMS IS QUANTIFIED AND THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LIVESTOCK SECTORS AND REGIONS ARE IDENTIFIED. WE HAVE SHOWED THAT IN FRANCE, LIVESTOCK ACTIVITIES MOBILIZE 41\% OF THE FRENCH AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, BUT DUE TO TERRITORIAL DIVERSITY, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN EUROPE, WHILE ALL COUNTRIES ARE AFFECTED BY A REDUCTION IN THE LIVESTOCK WORKFORCE, EMPLOYMENT TRENDS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON THE ANIMAL SECTOR. IN THE SECOND SECTION, WE ANALYSE TRENDS IN FARMERS' WORK THAT COULD EXPLAIN THE EVOLUTION OF AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT IN TERMS OF SLOWING OR ACCELERATING THE REDUCTION IN THE LIVESTOCK WORKFORCE. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHTED SUPPLY-DRIVEN FACTORS AND DEMAND-DRIVEN FACTORS TEND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LIVESTOCK WORKERS. SOME STRUCTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES PLAY A GREATER ROLE AS BOTH AN ACCELERATOR AND MODERATOR OF THE DECLINE IN LIVESTOCK WORKERS. THE THIRD SECTION FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTS OF LIVESTOCK EMPLOYMENT ON OTHER INDUSTRIES. WE SHOW THAT THE INDIRECT AND INDUCED EFFECTS OF LIVESTOCK FARMING VARY ACCORDING TO ACTIVITY SECTOR. DAIRY FARMS HAVE HIGHER INDUCED EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESSING ACTIVITIES CAN BE LIMITED LOCALLY BY THE LOW APPEAL OF MOST OF THE JOBS. IN THE CONCLUSION, WE HIGHLIGHT FOUR MAJOR ISSUES CONCERNING EMPLOYMENT AND WORK IN THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL.",""
