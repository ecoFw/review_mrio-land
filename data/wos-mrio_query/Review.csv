THUS, THIS INTRODUCTION INTO THE SI FIRSTLY IMPLEMENTS A SYSTEMATIC DATABASE TERM SEARCH AND FURTHER ANALYSES 129 PAPERS IDENTIFIED. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY REFERS TO THE ``LAWS'' OF THERMODYNAMICS. ONLY 33 PUBLICATIONS COULD BE RELATED TO EE AND LAW, LATTER IN THE SENSE OF THE RULE OF LAW, WITH QUITE EVEN ALLOCATION AMONG THE THREE STREAMS IDENTIFIED, NAMELY THEORETICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS, STRATEGIC TRANSITION AND TRANSFORMATION STUDIES, AND PRACTICAL CASE STUDIES. THE LITERATURE OVERVIEW ALSO CHRONOLOGICALLY INDICATES THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE 33 PAPERS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DURING THE PAST 15 YEARS. THE SECOND PART OF THIS INTRODUCTION DESCRIBES THE CONTENT OF THE SEVEN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS SI MORE IN DETAIL. AFTERWARDS IT SHOWS THAT THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TEND SIMILARLY MORE INTO THE DIRECTIONS OF PROVIDING STRATEGIC TRANSITION AND TRANSFORMATION STUDIES AS WELL AS PRACTICAL CASE STUDIES, INDICATING AN OVERALL SHIFT FROM THEORY TOWARDS PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF EE WITHIN LAW.",""

AN EMBODIMENT ACCOUNTING MODEL IS DEVELOPED, WHICH TAKES FULL ACCOUNT OF VIRTUAL WATER FEEDBACKS RELATED TO PRIMARY INPUTS. GLOBAL TOTAL TRADE VOLUME OF VIRTUAL WATER IS ESTIMATED TO BE IN MAGNITUDE AROUND 30\% OF THE GLOBAL DIRECT FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL. MOREOVER, IT IS REVEALED THAT GLOBAL VIRTUAL WATER TRANSFER IN INTERMEDIATE TRADE IS IN MAGNITUDE AROUND 1.4 TIMES THAT IN FINAL TRADE. IN INTERMEDIATE TRADE OF VIRTUAL WATER, CHINA, JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM TURN OUT TO BE THE THREE LEADING NET IMPORTERS, WHILE INDIA, RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE REVEALED AS THE LEADING NET EXPORTERS. IN FINAL TRADE OF VIRTUAL WATER, THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN AND RUSSIA ARE THE MAJOR NET IMPORTERS, IN CONTRAST TO CHINA, INDIA AND MEXICO AS THE LEADING NET EXPORTERS. TRADE CONNECTIONS AND IMBALANCES OF MAJOR ECONOMIES IN TERMS OF VIRTUAL WATER ARE QUANTIFIED AND ANALYZED. TWO NEW INDICATORS IN TERMS OF WATER SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATE BY SOURCE AND THAT BY SINK ARE DEVISED. IT IS FOUND THAT AROUND 40\% OF THE USE OF CHINA'S FRESHWATER WITHDRAWAL FINALLY SINKS INTO FOREIGN ECONOMIES WHILE ONLY 20\% OF CHINA'S VIRTUAL WATER USE ORIGINATES FROM OTHER REGIONS. WITH REGARD TO GERMANY, CANADA AND FRANCE, THEY BEHAVE LIKE ACTIVE PUMPS DRIVING VAST VIRTUAL WATER INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS, DEMONSTRATING THEIR HIGH INVOLVEMENT IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN IN TERMS OF VIRTUAL WATER. WITH THE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT VIRTUAL WATER TRANSFER WITHIN THE WORLD ECONOMY, NATIONS AND REGIONS OUGHT TO ASSESS THEIR BEHAVIORS IN INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES OF VIRTUAL WATER FOR SUSTAINABLE USE OF FRESHWATER RESOURCES.",""

DUE TO ITS COMPLEX BOTTOM TOPOGRAPHY, ALTERNATING MONSOON FORCING AND CONJUNCTION OF SEVERAL CURRENT SYSTEMS [SUCH AS THE ZHEJIANG-FUJIAN (ZHE-MIN) COASTAL CURRENT, THE KUROSHIO INTRUSION AND THE EXTENSION OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA WARM CURRENT], THE PHYSICAL AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH IN SPACE AND IN TIME. OUR RECENT INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES, COMBINING IN SITU AND REMOTE SENSING OBSERVATIONS WITH NUMERICAL MODELING, ALLOW US TO ADDRESS SEVERAL IMPORTANT ISSUES CONCERNING THE TAIWAN STRAIT. THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF CIRCULATION IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT IS MODULATED BY STRONG MONSOON FORCING, COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHY AND CIRCULATION IN THE NORTHERN SOUTH CHINA SEA AS WELL AS COASTAL WATER INPUT AND THE KUROSHIO INTRUSION. THE BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES OF CARBON AND NUTRIENTS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT DEPEND LARGELY ON THE PHYSICAL FORCING (EXTERNAL INPUT) AND THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE (INTERNAL CYCLING). THE PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT ARE DOMINATED BY NANO- AND PICO-PHYTOPLANKTON, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE MICROBIAL FOOD WEB TO THE TRADITIONAL FOOD WEB IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 30\%, IMPLYING THE FUNDAMENTAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MICROBIAL FOOD WEB IN THIS SUBTROPICAL REGION. UPWELLING IS A PREDOMINANT FEATURE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT AND SHOWS DYNAMIC SHORT-TERM, SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS. COMBINED HYDROGRAPHIC AND SATELLITE-DERIVED INFORMATION PROVIDES EVIDENCE ON THE TELECONNECTION BETWEEN THE TAIWAN STRAIT UPWELLING VARIATION AND THE EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO) CLIMATE VARIABILITY. UPWELLING HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES, BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY AND ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE. NOT ONLY THE BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTIVITY, BUT ALSO DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE REVEAL THE DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEM RESPONSES TO THE VARIATIONS IN UPWELLING, WHICH SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FISHERY RESOURCES. IN THIS OVERVIEW. WE SUMMARIZE THE HYDROGRAPHICAL FEATURES WITH AN EMPHASIS ON UPWELLING, WHICH IS THE KEY DRIVER OF BIOGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT.

THIS EDITORIAL ARTICLE INTRODUCES A SPECIAL ISSUE THAT TAKES STOCK OF RESEARCH ON PNS AND CRITICALLY EXPLORES HOW SUCH RESEARCH MAY DEVELOP. THROUGH REVIEWING THE HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF PNS, THE AUTHORS SEEK TO CLARIFY THE EXTANT DEFINITIONS, CONCEPTUALIZATIONS, AND USES OF PNS. THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY FIVE BROAD AREAS OF RESEARCH ON, OR USING, PNS WHICH HAVE DEVELOPED OVER FOUR DECADES. THEIR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE 1990S REPRESENT A SYMBOLIC WATERSHED IN THE USE OF PNS TERMINOLOGY, WHEN THE CONCEPT WAS FURTHER DEVELOPED AND APPLIED TO HIGHLY COMPLICATED ISSUES SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE. THE AUTHORS PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN USES OF PNS AS A NORMATIVE PRESCRIPTION AND AS A PRACTICAL METHOD. THROUGH THIS CLASSIFICATION, THEY SET OUT GAPS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARISING. THEY THEN BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE SPECIAL ISSUE ARTICLES AND CONSIDER THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO EACH OTHER AND THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS RAISED BY THEIR ANALYSIS. THEY CONCLUDE BY CONSIDERING WHAT THE ARTICLES IN THIS ISSUE SUGGEST FOR FUTURE THEORY BUILDING IN PNS AND RELATED SCHOLARSHIP.",""

IN THIS INTRODUCTORY PAPER, WE SET THE STAGE FOR THE REST OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS BY REVIEWING THE MAIN ISSUES ARISING IN PES DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION AND DISCUSSING THESE IN THE LIGHT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS. WE START WITH A DISCUSSION OF PES DEFINITION AND SCOPE. WE PROCEED TO REVIEW SOME OF THE PRINCIPAL DIMENSIONS AND DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS OF PES PROGRAMS AND THEN ANALYZE HOW PES COMPARES TO ALTERNATIVE POLICY INSTRUMENTS. FINALLY, WE EXAMINE IN DETAIL TWO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PES PROGRAMS: THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS. PES IS NOT A SILVER BULLET THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS ANY ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM, BUT A TOOL TAILORED TO ADDRESS A SPECIFIC SET OF PROBLEMS: THOSE IN WHICH ECOSYSTEMS ARE MISMANAGED BECAUSE MANY OF THEIR BENEFITS ARE EXTERNALITIES FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ECOSYSTEM MANAGERS. PES IS BASED ON THE BENEFICIARY-PAYS RATHER THAN THE POLLUTER-PAYS PRINCIPLE, AND AS SUCH IS ATTRACTIVE IN SETTINGS WHERE ES PROVIDERS ARE POOR, MARGINALIZED LANDHOLDERS OR POWERFUL GROUPS OF ACTORS. AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION WITHIN PES IS BETWEEN USER-FINANCED PES IN WHICH THE BUYERS ARE THE USERS OF THE ES, AND GOVERNMENT-FINANCED PES IN WHICH THE BUYERS ARE OTHERS (TYPICALLY THE GOVERNMENT) ACTING ON BEHALF OF ES USERS. IN PRACTICE, PES PROGRAMS DIFFER IN THE TYPE AND SCALE OF ES DEMAND, THE PAYMENT SOURCE, THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY PAID FOR, THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE USED, AS WELL AS THE PAYMENT MODE AND AMOUNT. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF PES DEPENDS CRUCIALLY ON PROGRAM DESIGN. (C) 2008 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER B.V.",""

THIS STRATEGY, EMBODYING INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE USE OF THE PRIVATE DISCOUNT RATE, ASSUMES THAT MARKET SIGNALS WILL ELICIT SATISFACTORY SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF EXCESSIVE RESOURCE DEPLETION AND POLLUTION. IT HAS BEEN ARGUED, HOWEVER, THAT METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS HAVE UNDERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE ORTHODOX APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS. FURTHERMORE, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THIS APPROACH IS FUNDAMENTALLY ANTHROPOCENTRIC IN CHARACTER AND THEREFORE UNSUITED TO RESOLVING PROBLEMS WHICH ARE SEEN TO BE ESSENTIALLY ECOLOGICAL IN CHARACTER.

AS SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE BECOMES A DISTINCTIVE RESEARCH FIELD, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEFINE SUSTAINABILITY CLEARLY AND GRASP THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE, CURRENT STATUS, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE. THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN ACADEMIC LANDSCAPE OF SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE BY ANALYZING THE CITATION NETWORK OF PAPERS PUBLISHED IN ACADEMIC JOURNALS. A TOPOLOGICAL CLUSTERING METHOD IS USED TO DETECT THE SUB-DOMAINS OF SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE. RESULTS SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF 15 MAIN RESEARCH CLUSTERS: AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES, ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS, FORESTRY (AGROFORESTRY), FORESTRY (TROPICAL RAIN FOREST), BUSINESS, TOURISM, WATER, FORESTRY (BIODIVERSITY), URBAN PLANNING, RURAL SOCIOLOGY, ENERGY, HEALTH, SOIL, AND WILDLIFE. AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES, ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS, AND FORESTRY (AGROFORESTRY) CLUSTERS ARE PREDOMINANT AMONG THESE. THE ENERGY CLUSTER IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING, AS INDICATED BY THE AGE OF PAPERS IN THE CLUSTER, ALTHOUGH IT HAS A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PAPERS. THESE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THOSE OBTAINED BY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.

INTEGRATED PRODUCT POLICY (IPP) ADDRESSING THE LIFE-CYCLE IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS FORMS AN INNOVATIVE NEW GENERATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY YET THIS POLICY REQUIRES INSIGHT INTO THE FINAL CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES AND RELATED PRODUCTS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST LIFE-CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THIS REVIEW ARTICLE BRINGS TOGETHER THE CONCLUSIONS OF 11 STUDIES THAT ANALYZE THE LIFE-CYCLE IMPACTS OF TOTAL SOCIETAL CONSUMPTION AND THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT FINAL CONSUMPTION CATEGORIES, THIS REVIEW ADDRESSES IN GENERAL STUDIES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS (EIPRO) OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. UNLIKE MOST STUDIES DONE IN THE PAST 25 YEARS ON SIMILAR TOPICS, THE STUDIES REVIEWED HERE COVERED A BROAD SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BEYOND JUST ENERGY USE OR CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS. THE STUDIES DIFFERED GREATLY IN BASIC APPROACH (EXTRAPOLATING LCA DATA TO IMPACTS OF CONSUMPTION CATEGORIES VERSUS APPROACHES BASED ON ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT (EEIO) TABLES), GEOGRAPHICAL REGION, DISAGGREGATION OF FINAL DEMAND, DATA INVENTORY USED, AND METHOD OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT. NEVERTHELESS, ACROSS ALL STUDIES A LIMITED NUMBER OF PRIORITIES EMERGED. THE THREE MAIN PRIORITIES, HOUSING, TRANSPORT, AND FOOD, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 70\% OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN MOST CATEGORIES, ALTHOUGH COVERING ONLY 55\% OF THE FINAL EXPENDITURE IN THE 25 COUNTRIES THAT CURRENTLY MAKE UP THE EU. AT A MORE DETAILED LEVEL, PRIORITIES ARE CAR AND MOST PROBABLY AIR TRAVEL WITHIN TRANSPORT, MEAT AND DAIRY WITHIN FOOD, AND BUILDING STRUCTURES, HEATING, AND (ELECTRICAL) ENERGY-USING PRODUCTS WITHIN HOUSING. EXPENDITURES ON CLOTHING, COMMUNICATION, HEALTH CARE, AND EDUCATION ARE CONSIDERABLY LESS IMPORTANT. GIVEN THE VERY DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOLLOWED IN EACH OF THE SOURCES REVIEWED, THIS RESULT HENCE MUST BE REGARDED AS EXTREMELY ROBUST. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN TO HARMONIZE AND IMPROVE THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES OF SUCH ANALYSES, FOR INSTANCE, WITH REGARD TO MODELING OF IMPORTS, INCLUSION OF CAPITAL GOODS, AND MAKING AN EXPLICIT DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOUSEHOLD AND GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE.",""

THE SUMMER MONSOON SYSTEM OVER EAST ASIA (INCLUDING THE SOUTH CHINA SEA (SCS)) CANNOT BE JUST THOUGHT OF AS THE EASTWARD AND NORTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE INDIAN MONSOON. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THE HUGE ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON SYSTEM CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO SUBSYSTEMS: THE INDIAN AND THE EAST ASIAN MONSOON SYSTEM WHICH ARE TO A GREATER EXTENT INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE MAJOR FINDINGS MADE IN RECENT TWO DECADES ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW: (1) THE EARLIEST ONSET OF THE ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON OCCURS IN MOST OF CASES IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN INDOCHINA PENINSULA. THE ONSET IS PRECEDED BY DEVELOPMENT OF A BOB (BAY OF BENGAL) CYCLONE, THE RAPID ACCELERATION OF LOW-LEVEL WESTERLIES AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN BOTH AREAL EXTENT AND INTENSITY IN THE TROPICAL EAST INDIAN OCEAN AND THE BAY OF BENGAL. (2) THE SEASONAL MATCH OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON DISPLAYS A DISTINCT STEPWISE NORTHWARD AND NORTHEASTWARD ADVANCE, WITH TWO ABRUPT NORTHWARD JUMPS AND THREE STATIONARY PERIODS. THE MONSOON RAIN COMMENCES OVER THE REGION FROM THE INDOCHINA PENINSULA-THE SCS-PHILIPPINES DURING THE PERIOD FROM EARLY MAY TO MID-MAY, THEN IT EXTENDS ABRUPTLY TO THE YANGTZE RIVER BASIN, AND WESTERN AND SOUTHERN JAPAN, AND THE SOUTHWESTERN PHILIPPINE SEA IN EARLY TO MID-JUNE AND FINALLY PENETRATES TO NORTH CHINA, KOREA AND PART OF JAPAN, AND THE TOPICAL WESTERN WEST PACIFIC. (3) AFTER THE ONSET OF THE ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON, THE MOISTURE TRANSPORT COMING FROM INDOCHINA PENINSULA AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA PLAYS A CRUCIAL ``SWITCH'' ROLE IN MOISTURE SUPPLY FOR PRECIPITATION IN EAST ASIA, THUS LEADING TO A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN CLIMATE REGIME IN EAST ASIA AND EVEN MORE REMOTE AREAS THROUGH TELECONNECTION. (4) THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON AND RELATED SEASONAL RAIN BELTS ASSUMES SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY AT INTRASEASONAL, INTERANNUAL AND INTERDECADAL TIME SCALES. THEIR INTERACTION, I.E., PHASE LOCKING AND IN-PHASE OR OUT-PHASE SUPERIMPOSING, CAN TO A GREATER EXTENT CONTROL THE BEHAVIORS OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON AND PRODUCE UNIQUE RYTHEM AND SINGULARITIES. (5) TWO EXTERNAL FORCING I.E., PACIFIC AND INDIAN OCEAN SSTS AND THE SNOW COVER IN THE EURASIA AND THE TIBETAN PLATEAU, ARE BELIEVED TO BE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE ACTIVITY OF THE EAST ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON. HOWEVER, THE INTERNAL VARIABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. IN PARTICULAR, THE BLOCKING HIGHS IN MID-AND HIGH LATITUDES OF EURASIAN CONTINENTS AND THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH OVER THE WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT FRONT THE CONDITION FOR THE SOUTH ASIAN MONSOON. THE LATER IS OF TROPICAL MONSOON NATURE WHILE THE FORMER IS OF HYBRID NATURE OF TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL MONSOON WITH INTENSE IMPACT FROM MID-AND HIGH LATITUDES.",""

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH FOUR WELL-KNOWN APPROACHES TO ANALYSIS OF COST OF CORROSION VIZ., THE UHLIG METHOD, THE HOAR METHOD, NBS-BCL INPUT/OUTPUT METHOD AND NET PRESENT VALUE METHOD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IN GREAT DETAIL AND THE IMPACT OF THESE APPROACHES ON CORROSION ECONOMY IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED. FINDINGS UHLIG METHOD OF ESTIMATING CORROSION COST ALWAYS GIVES A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF THE DIRECT COST OF CORROSION. THE DIRECT COST OF CORROSION, AS ESTIMATED BY THE HOAR METHOD, IS FOUND TO BE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN IS THE ESTIMATE MADE USING THE UHLIG METHOD, AS SHOWN BY SHIBATA OF JAPAN. THE NBS-BCL METHOD OF INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS, THOUGH APPARENTLY MORE SCIENTIFIC, IS SUBJECT ULTIMATELY TO UNCERTAINTIES IN QUANTIFYING THE CAPITAL COST AND INTERMEDIATE OUTPUT. THE NET PRESENT VALUE METHOD APPEARS TO BE MORE REALISTIC THAN DO OTHER APPROACHES AS IT ENABLES A LIFE CYCLE COSTING OF EACH STRUCTURE/FACILITY TO BE MADE AND ARRIVES AT THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE CORROSION CONTROL METHOD. EVEN THOUGH ALL THE ABOVE FOUR APPROACHES ENABLE AN ESTIMATION OF DIRECT COST OF CORROSION, THERE IS NO STANDARD APPROACH TO ASSESS THE INDIRECT COST OF CORROSION.

THIS PAPER SYNTHESIZES RESULTS OF PUBLISHED MODELING STUDIES THAT EXAMINED THE GROUNDWATER SYSTEM AND HYDROLOGIC CYCLE UNDER THE REPRESENTATIVE CONCENTRATION PATHWAY (RCP) 8.5 SCENARIO (CO2 AT 936-PPM LEVEL AT YEAR 2100). NATURAL REPLENISHMENT OF GROUNDWATER OCCURS PREDOMINANTLY FROM INFILTRATION OF PRECIPITATION AND SURFACE IMPOUNDMENTS. THEREFORE, THE FIRST STAGE OF THE STUDY WAS TO REVIEW A CHANGED HYDROLOGIC CYCLE UNDER RCP 8.5 IN TERMS OF INFLUENCE FROM (1) PRECIPITATION, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, AND SOIL MOISTURE; (2) SURFACE WATER AND ITS INTERACTION WITH GROUNDWATER; (3) EXTREME HYDROLOGIC EVENTS, AND (4) TELECONNECTION PATTERNS. THE GENERAL PATTERN OF CLIMATE IMPACT ON GROUNDWATER RESOURCES FOLLOWS THE PRECIPITATION PATTERN WITH DEPLETION IN TROPICAL AND/OR SUBTROPICAL REGIONS AND WITH INCREASE IN THE HIGH-LATITUDE REGIONS OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES. HOWEVER, REGIONAL VARIABILITY ALSO CORRESPONDS TO THE HETEROGENOUS IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGES ON REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF PRECIPITATION AND EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, LOCALIZED INTERACTION BETWEEN SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER, AND DISTANCES FROM THE OCEANS WITH RISING SEA LEVEL. THE DECLINE OF THE WATER TABLE IN MANY AREAS MAY SERIOUSLY REDUCE IRRIGATED CROP PRODUCTION AND ADVERSELY IMPACT GROUNDWATER-DEPENDENT ECOSYSTEMS.
