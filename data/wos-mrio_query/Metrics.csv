THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES DEMAND-DRIVEN NATURAL RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS AND SPATIAL OUTSOURCING WITHIN CHINA IN 2012 BY USING THE LATEST MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. EXERGY IS ADOPTED AS A COMMON METRIC FOR NATURAL RESOURCES INPUT. THE TOTAL DOMESTIC RESOURCE EXERGY REQUIREMENTS AMOUNTED TO 125.5 EJ, OF WHICH THE EASTERN AREA CONTRIBUTED THE LARGEST SHARE OF 44.5\%, FOLLOWED BY THE WESTERN AREA (23.9\%), THE CENTRAL AREA (23.0\%) AND THE NORTHEASTERN AREA (8.6\%). INVESTMENT WAS THE LEADING FINAL DEMAND CATEGORY, ACCOUNTING FOR 52.9\% (66.4 EJ) OF NATIONAL TOTAL EMBODIED RESOURCE USE (ERU). THE TOTAL TRADE VOLUMES OF EMBODIED RESOURCE WERE EQUIVALENT TO 69.6\% OF THE TOTAL DIRECT RESOURCE INPUT (DRI), MOSTLY TRANSFERRED FROM THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGIONS SUCH AS INNER MONGOLIA, SHANXI, SHAANXI AND XINJIANG TO THE EASTERN REGIONS SUCH AS JIANGSU, ZHEJIANG, GUANGDONG AND SHANGHAI. THE NORTHEASTERN AND EASTERN AREAS HAD PHYSICAL NET IMPORTS OF 1213.5 PJ AND 38452.6 PJ, WHILE THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN INLAND AREAS HAD PHYSICAL NET EXPORTS OF 6364.5 PJ AND 33301.5 PJ, RESPECTIVELY. SHANGHAI, BEIJING, ZHEJIANG, JIANGSU AND GUANGDONG HAD PROMINENT ERUS WHICH RESPECTIVELY WERE 101.6, 12.6, 11.7, 8.4 AND 4.3 TIMES OF THEIR DRIS. THE ERUS OF INNER MONGOLIA, SHAANXI, SHANXI, NINGXIA AND GUIZHOU WERE EQUAL TO ONLY 17.6\%, 25.3\%, 27.9\%, 46.0\% AND 50.2\% OF THEIR DRIS, RESPECTIVELY. REGIONAL UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT RESULTED IN IMBALANCED RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ACROSS CHINA. THE FINDINGS CAN PROVIDE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S RESOURCE-DRIVEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MODE, AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING REGIONAL RESOURCE FOOTPRINTS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT OUTCOMES UNDER THE ``NEW NORMAL ECONOMY''.",""

THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF HOW TO PRIORITIZE SUCH ISSUES. USING THE MRIO DATABASE, EXIOBASE, WE ADDRESS THE GRN CONSIDERING FIVE KEY RESOURCES: BLUE WATER, PRIMARY ENERGY, LAND, METAL ORES, AND MINERALS. WE PROPOSE A METRIC OF NEXUS STRENGTH, WHICH RELIES ON LINEAR GOAL PROGRAMMING TO RANK INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS BASED ON ITS ASSOCIATED COMBINED RESOURCE USE AND VARIOUS WEIGHTING SCHEMES. OUR RESULTS VALIDATE CURRENT RESEARCH EFFORTS BY IDENTIFYING WATER, ENERGY, AND LAND AS THE STRONGEST LINKAGES GLOBALLY AND AT ALL SCALES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, LEAD TO NOVEL FINDINGS INTO THE GRN, IN THAT (1) IT APPEARS STRONGER AND MORE COMPLEX FROM THE CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVE, (2) METALS AND MINERALS EMERGE AS CRITICAL, YET UNDERVALUED, COMPONENTS, AND (3) IT MANIFESTS WITH A CONSIDERABLE DIVERSITY ACROSS COUNTRIES OWING TO DIFFERENCES IN THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, DOMESTIC POLICY, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS.",""

IN 2012, THE TOTAL DOMESTIC RESOURCE EXERGY INPUT INTO CHINESE ECONOMIC SYSTEM AMOUNTED TO 130.1 EJ, OF WHICH 44.6\% WAS INDUCED BY INVESTMENT DEMANDS. THE EMBODIED RESOURCE USE (ERU) IN CHINA'S EXPORTS WAS EQUIVALENT TO OVER ONE FIFTH OF ITS DOMESTIC RESOURCE SUPPLY. THE TWO INTEGRATIVE SECTORS OF MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTED FOR 44.1\% AND 28.7\% OF THE NATIONAL TOTAL ERU, RESPECTIVELY. WE IDENTIFIED CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN PATHS STARTING FROM RESOURCE EXTRACTION TO FINAL DEMAND, AS WELL AS KEY INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN DRIVING THE EXTRACTION, TRANSMISSION AND FINAL USE OF EMBODIED RESOURCES. THE TOP 50 PATHS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 30.4 EJ OF THE ERU. THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCE SUPPLY CHAINS FROM A SYSTEMIC PERSPECTIVE IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WHEN RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES ARE TO BE APPLIED TO CONCRETE INDUSTRIAL SECTORS AND OTHER ECONOMIC AGENTS.

THIS IS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY GLOBAL WITH COUNTRIES RELYING ON EACH OTHER THROUGH TRADE. AS SUCH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN SHIFTS FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER. TO THIS END, THIS PAPER EXPLOITS A PARADOX IN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, WHICH STEMS FROM A FALSE DECOUPLING BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AS OBSERVED IN MOST DEVELOPED NATIONS, WHICH RESULTS IN IMPROVED TERRITORIAL EMISSIONS OF THESE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AT THE EXPENSE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

AN INCREASING SHARE OF THIS DEMAND IS MET THROUGH TRADE AND IMPORTS. THE UNPRECEDENTED RAPID GROWTH, EXTENT, AND COMPLEXITY OF GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS) SINCE THE 1980S HAVE RESHAPED GLOBAL TRADE. THE GVCS - AND NEW ECONOMIC PATTERNS OF REGIONALIZATION - AFFECT THE DEMANDS ON WATER, ENERGY, AND FOOD WITHIN COUNTRIES AND ACROSS GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. EAST ASIA IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST DUE TO THE REGION'S RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH, SUBSTANTIAL POPULATION SIZE, HIGH INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE REGION'S ECONOMIES, AND VARYING DEGREE OF RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. WHILE GREATER INTERDEPENDENCE ACROSS THE REGION HAS INCREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION AND TRADE, THESE ACTIVITIES REQUIRE THE INPUT OF WATER-ENERGY-FOOD AND GENERATE DISTURBANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TRANSNATIONAL INTER-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH IS UTILIZED IN A TELE-CONNECTED WATER ENERGY-FOOD NEXUS (WEFN) ANALYSIS OF THE EAST ASIA GVC TO ASSESS COMPETING DEMANDS FOR THESE RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES. THIS ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THE HIDDEN VIRTUAL FLOWS OF WATER, ENERGY, AND FOOD EMBODIED IN INTRA-REGIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL INTER-REGIONAL TRADE. CHINA'S CURRENT NATIONAL EXPORT ORIENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGY IN EAST ASIA IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FROM THE WEFN PERSPECTIVE. CHINA IS A NET VIRTUAL EXPORTER OF NEXUS RESOURCES TO JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. CHINA'S PRIORITIZATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TRADE IN LOW VALUE ADDED AND POLLUTION INTENSIVE SECTORS CONSUMES A GREAT AMOUNT OF NEXUS RESOURCES WITHIN ITS TERRITORY TO SATISFY CONSUMERS' DEMANDS IN JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. JAPAN'S KANTO AND KINKI REGIONS AND SOUTH KOREA'S SUDOKWON REGION WERE THE MAJOR BENEFICIARIES WHILE CHINA BORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF EXPORTS.

THE HYBRID WATER FLOW, AS THE SUM OF THE DIRECT WATER FLOW AND ENERGY-RELATED WATER FLOW, IS COMBINED WITH THE HYBRID ENERGY FLOW TO BUILD THE HYBRID NETWORK. THEN THE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ECONOMIC SECTORS AND THE NEXUS IMPACTS WERE EXPLORED VIA INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MANUFACTURE (MA) PROVIDES THE LARGEST OUTFLOW OF HYBRID ENERGY, AND AGRICULTURE (AG) IS THE LARGEST RECEIVER. THE MAJOR EXPORT-IMPORT PAIRS OF HYBRID WATER ARE AG-MA, MA-CO (CONSTRUCTION), SERVICE(SE)-TRANSPORTATION AND MAILING (TR), MA-SE, AND TR MA. THESE MAJOR EXPORT-IMPORT PAIRS (MA-AG) AS WELL AS MA ITSELF ARE THE CRITICAL POINTS FOR ENERGY AND WATER NEXUS MANAGEMENT. THE RESULTS OF THE NEXUS IMPACTS SHOWED THAT AG, TR, AND CO ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTORS. THIS STUDY MAY HELP IDENTIFY THE LEVERAGE POINTS AND REGULATING PATHWAYS OF URBAN ENERGY-WATER SYSTEM AND PROVIDE A BETTER WAY FOR MITIGATING THE URBAN ENERGY AND WATER PRESSURES.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - INITIALLY, THE ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES OF US ECONOMY AND CARBON FOOTPRINT MULTIPLIERS WERE COLLECTED FROM EORA DATABASE (LENZEN ET AL., 2012). THEN, ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODELS WERE DEVELOPED TO QUANTIFY THE CARBON FOOTPRINT EXTENTS OF THE US MANUFACTURING SECTORS BETWEEN 1970 AND 2011. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS ASSESSED IN METRIC TONS OF CO2-EQUIVALENT, WHEREAS THE ECONOMIC OUTPUTS WERE MEASURED IN MILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. FINDINGS - THE SALIENT FINDING OF THIS PAPER IS THAT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT STOCK HAS BEEN INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE LAST FOUR DECADES. THE STEEP GROWTH IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT UNFORTUNATELY OVER-SHADOWED THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT WERE OBTAINED FROM LOWER CO2 INTENSITIES. ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC INDUSTRY RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE TOP FIVE MANUFACTURING SECTORS BASED ON TOTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT SHARE ARE ``PETROLEUM REFINERIES,'' ``ANIMAL (EXCEPT POULTRY) SLAUGHTERING, RENDERING, AND PROCESSING,'' ``OTHER BASIC ORGANIC CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING,'' ``MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS MANUFACTURING,'' AND ``IRON AND STEEL MILLS AND FERROALLOY MANUFACTURING.''

FOCUSING ON STEEL, WE USED CURRENT PROCESS PARAMETERS, LOSS RATES, AND TRADE PATTERNS OF THE STEEL CYCLE TO STUDY HOW STEEL THAT WAS ORIGINALLY CONTAINED IN HIGH QUALITY APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MACHINERY OR VEHICLES WITH STRINGENT PURITY REQUIREMENTS GETS SUBSEQUENTLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT REGIONS AND PRODUCT GROUPS SUCH AS BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION WITH LESS STRINGENT PURITY REQUIREMENTS. WE APPLIED MATRACE GLOBAL, A SUPPLY-DRIVEN MULTIREGIONAL MODEL OF STEEL FLOWS COUPLED TO A DYNAMIC STOCK MODEL OF STEEL USE.

BASED ON FINDINGS FROM THE 2009 A H1N1 PANDEMIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (NCR), THIS PAPER PRESENTS A RECOVERY ANALYSIS FOR WORKFORCE DISRUPTIONS USING ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT MODELING. THE MODEL FORMULATION TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE DYNAMIC INTERDEPENDENCIES ACROSS SECTORS IN AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ECONOMIC SECTORS. FROM A MACROECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, THE RISK OF THE INFLUENZA DISASTER CAN BE MODELED USING TWO RISK METRICS. FIRST, THERE IS THE LEVEL OF INOPERABILITY, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IDEAL PRODUCTION LEVEL AND THE DEGRADED PRODUCTION LEVEL. SECOND, THE ECONOMIC LOSS METRIC REPRESENTS THE FINANCIAL VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCED OUTPUT. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK REVOLVES AROUND THE MODELING OF UNCERTAINTIES TRIGGERED BY NEW PERTURBATIONS TO INTERDEPENDENT ECONOMIC SECTORS WITHIN AN INFLUENZA PANDEMIC TIMELINE. WE MODEL THE LEVEL OF INOPERABILITY OF ECONOMIC SECTORS THROUGHOUT THEIR RECOVERY HORIZON FROM THE INITIAL OUTBREAK OF THE DISASTER USING A DYNAMIC MODEL. MOREOVER, WE USE THE LEVEL OF INOPERABILITY VALUES TO QUANTIFY THE CUMULATIVE ECONOMIC LOSSES INCURRED BY THE SECTORS WITHIN THE RECOVERY HORIZON. FINALLY, WE REVISIT THE 2009 NCR PANDEMIC SCENARIO TO DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS IN MODELING THE INOPERABILITY AND ECONOMIC LOSS BEHAVIORS DUE TO TIME-VARYING PERTURBATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED RIPPLE EFFECTS TO INTERDEPENDENT ECONOMIC SECTORS.",""

ACCOUNTING FOR ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES INTRODUCES THE CHALLENGE OF HOW TO AGGREGATE RESOURCES OF WIDELY VARYING QUALITIES SUCH AS SUNLIGHT, WOOD, WATER, AND COAL. METHODS BASED ON MASS, ENERGY, AND EXERGY HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND ARE EVALUATED IN THIS WORK. IN ADDITION, THIS WORK AIMS TO ANALYZE THREE LCA TECHNIQUES WITH DIFFERENT SYSTEM BOUNDARIES: CONVENTIONAL PROCESS-BASED LCA, HYBRID ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT LCA (EIO-LCA), AND HYBRID ECOLOGICALLY BASED LCA (ECO-LCA). THESE THREE METHODS ARE APPLIED TO THE CASE STUDY OF 1,3-PROPANEDIOL (PDO) PRODUCED VIA FOSSIL-BASED AND BIO-BASED FEEDSTOCKS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT A HIERARCHICAL SET OF METRICS CAN BE USEFUL FOR GAINING INSIGHT INTO THE ROLE OF ECOSYSTEM RESOURCES IN A LIFE CYCLE. AMONG AGGREGATION METHODS, ECOLOGICAL CUMULATIVE EXERGY CONSUMPTION SEEMS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL RESULTS, BUT MORE EMPIRICAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED. IT IS ALSO DETERMINED THAT BIO-BASED PDO IS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN FOSSIL-BASED PDO BECAUSE OF LESS NONRENEWABLE RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, BIO-BASED PDO DOES RELY MORE ON LAND, WATER, AND FERTILE SOIL. BY DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF MAKING THE CURRENT PDO DEMAND ENTIRELY FROM CORN, IT IS FOUND THAT THE CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES RELATIVE TO NATIONAL CONSUMPTION IS VERY LOW.

THE DURATION OF THE CLIMATOLOGICAL GROWING SEASON HAS INCREASED +0.27 D/YR, EXTENDING PRIMARILY INTO AUTUMN. SUMMER PRECIPITATION IN OUR STUDY AREA HAS DECLINED BY AN AVERAGE -0.34 CM/YR, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO MOISTURE STRESS THAT IMPAIRS VEGETATION CARBON UPTAKE RATES AND CAN RENDER THE FOREST MORE VULNERABLE TO DISTURBANCE. MANY CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE, PRECIPITATION, AND CLIMATOLOGICAL GROWING SEASON ARE MOST PROMINENT IN LOCATIONS WHERE LAKE SUPERIOR EXERTS A STRONG HYDROCLIMATOLOGICAL INFLUENCE, ESPECIALLY THE MINNESOTA SHORELINE AND IN FOREST AREAS DOWNWIND (SOUTHEAST) OF THE LAKE. OBSERVED TRENDS IN LAKE TEMPERATURE AND ICE PHENOLOGY HAVE ALSO CHANGED, COINCIDENT WITH A LARGE-SCALE CLIMATOLOGICAL REGIME SHIFT AROUND 1998. A NUMBER OF FACTORS ARE LIKELY ALTERING FOREST PHENOLOGY AND THE ROLE OF THE FOREST IN THE CLIMATE SYSTEM OF THIS ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT AND HIGHLY VARIED FOREST-AND-LAKE REGION.",""

WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER IT STILL EXISTS IN THE CMIP PHASE 5 (CMIP5) MODELS AND, IF SO, WHAT CAUSES THESE BIASES? OUR EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS SHOWS THAT SOME MODELS STILL UNDERESTIMATE RAINFALL OVER AMAZONIA. DURING THE DRY SEASON, BOTH CONVECTIVE AND LARGE-SCALE PRECIPITATION IS UNDERESTIMATED IN MOST MODELS. GFDL-ESM2M AND IPSL NOTABLY SHOW MORE PENTADS WITH NO RAINFALL. DURING THE WET SEASON, LARGE-SCALE PRECIPITATION IS STILL UNDERESTIMATED IN MOST MODELS. IN THE DRY AND TRANSITION SEASONS, MODELS WITH MORE REALISTIC MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND SURFACE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION GENERALLY HAVE MORE REALISTIC RAINFALL TOTALS. IN SOME MODELS, OVERESTIMATES OF RAINFALL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADJACENT TROPICAL AND EASTERN PACIFIC ITCZS. HOWEVER, IN OTHER MODELS, TOO MUCH SURFACE NET RADIATION AND A RESULTANT HIGH BOWEN RATIO APPEARS TO CAUSE UNDERESTIMATES OF RAINFALL. DURING THE TRANSITION SEASON, LOW PRE-SEASONAL LATENT HEAT, HIGH SENSIBLE FLUX, AND A WEAKER INFLUENCE OF COLD AIR INCURSIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DRY BIAS. ABOUT HALF THE MODELS CAN CAPTURE, BUT OVERESTIMATE, THE INFLUENCES OF TELECONNECTION. BASED ON A SIMPLE METRIC, HADGEM2-ES OUTPERFORMS OTHER MODELS ESPECIALLY FOR SURFACE CONDITIONS AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION. GFDL-ESM2M HAS THE STRONGEST DRY BIAS PRESUMABLY DUE TO ITS OVERESTIMATE OF MOISTURE DIVERGENCE, INDUCED BY OVERESTIMATED ITCZS IN ADJACENT OCEANS, AND REINFORCED BY POSITIVE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN REDUCED CLOUDINESS, HIGH BOWEN RATIO AND SUPPRESSION OF RAINFALL DURING THE DRY SEASON, AND TOO WEAK INCURSIONS OF EXTRATROPICAL DISTURBANCES DURING THE TRANSITION SEASON.",""

PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN MODELING THESE ASPECTS OF THE MONSOON, THOUGH THERE IS NO SINGLE MODEL THAT BEST REPRESENTS ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF THE MONSOON. THE CMIP5 MULTI-MODEL MEAN (MMM) IS MORE SKILLFUL THAN THE CMIP3 MMM FOR ALL DIAGNOSTICS IN TERMS OF THE SKILL OF SIMULATING PATTERN CORRELATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OBSERVATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR RAINFALL/CONVECTION THE MMM OUTPERFORMS THE INDIVIDUAL MODELS FOR THE TIME MEAN, THE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF THE EAST ASIAN MONSOON, AND INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY. THE PATTERN CORRELATION OF THE TIME (PENTAD) OF MONSOON PEAK AND WITHDRAWAL IS BETTER SIMULATED THAN THAT OF MONSOON ONSET. THE ONSET OF THE MONSOON OVER INDIA IS TYPICALLY TOO LATE IN THE MODELS. THE EXTENSION OF THE MONSOON OVER EASTERN CHINA, KOREA, AND JAPAN IS UNDERESTIMATED, WHILE IT IS OVERESTIMATED OVER THE SUBTROPICAL WESTERN/CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN.
