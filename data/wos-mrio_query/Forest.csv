IN THIS STUDY, CARBON EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN FOREST PRODUCTS TRADE ARE EXAMINED THROUGH A MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. COMPARED WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES, THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS DEAN WITH A SMALL TOTAL EMISSION AND MEAN EMISSION INTENSITY. THE PAPER SECTOR IS MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN TOTAL EMISSION AND DIRTIER IN EMISSION INTENSITY THAN THE WOOD SECTOR. MOST COUNTRIES WITH EXTENSIVE FOREST PRODUCTS TRADE HAVE EXPERIENCED DECLINING CONSUMPTION-BASED CARBON EMISSIONS OVER 1995-2009, AND ALL COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME CLEANER BASED ON THE EMISSION INTENSITY VALUE. CARBON EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF FOREST PRODUCTS ARE ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF TOTAL EMISSIONS FROM PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. DEVELOPING COUNTRIES GENERALLY HAVE MUCH HIGHER EMISSION INTENSITIES THAN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE CARBON EMISSION DATA HAVE A LARGER IMPACT THAN THOSE IN THE INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL CONSUMPTION DATA. THESE FINDINGS ARE HELPFUL FOR POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC-ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS OF FOREST PRODUCTS TRADE AND TO IMPROVE POLICY AND AGREEMENT DESIGNS.",""

HERE WE APPLIED A MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH BASED ON THE WORLD INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASE (WIOD) TO QUANTIFY GLOBAL GWF OF 40 COUNTRIES/REGIONS WITH 35 ECONOMIC SECTORS. THE GWF FROM BOTH THE PRODUCTION PERSPECTIVE (GWFP), AND THE CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVE (GWFC) ARE QUANTIFIED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GLOBAL GWFP/GWFC WAS 1507.9 KM(3) IN 2009. EXCEPT FOR THE ``AGRICULTURE, HUNTING, FORESTRY AND FISHING'' SECTOR, THE INDUSTRIAL SECTORS WITH THE LARGEST GWFC WERE ``FOOD, BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO'' ``CONSTRUCTION'' ``CHEMICALS AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS'' AND ``TEXTILES AND TEXTILE PRODUCTS''. THE BRIC COUNTRIES (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA) HAD A LARGER GWFP THAN THEIR GWFC, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR OVER HALF OF GLOBAL GWFP (53.6\%), AND THEIR GWFP WAS MAINLY GENERATED FROM THE PRODUCTION OF DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND. IN CONTRAST, THE OECD29 AND EU27 GROUPS OF COUNTRIES I.E. THE COUNTRY GROUPS CONSISTING MAINLY OF ECONOMICALLY ADVANCED NATIONS, HAD LARGER GWFC THAN THEIR GWFP. OVERALL, THE OECD29 AND EU27 OUTSOURCED 134.8 KM(3) AND 64.4 KM(3) OF THEIR GREY WATER RESPECTIVELY, MOSTLY TO LARGE NEWLY ADVANCED ECONOMIES SUCH AS THE BRIC GROUP OF COUNTRIES, WHICH, IN TURN, WERE COLLECTIVELY OUTSOURCING 112 KM(3) OF GREY WATER.

CHINA HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING RADICAL LAND USE CHANGES SINCE ITS ECONOMIC REFORM IN 1978. THE QUANTIFICATION OF LAND TELECONNECTIONS IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING LAND-RELATED SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE LAND TELECONNECTIONS IN CHINA AT THE PROVINCIAL SCALE, USING A MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL AND THE LATEST DOMESTIC TRADE DATA IN 2012. IT IS FOUND THAT LARGE AMOUNTS OF LAND IN THE WESTERN PROVINCES OF CHINA ARE CONSUMED BY THE COASTAL PROVINCES. MORE THAN 90\% OF LAND CONSUMED BY BEIJING, TIANJIN AND SHANGHAI IS FROM OTHER PROVINCES. AGRICULTURAL LAND MAINLY TRANSFERS IN THE WEST-TO-EAST AND NORTH-TO-SOUTH DIRECTIONS. THE REGIONS IN NORTHEAST AND NORTHWEST CHINA HAVE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND OUTFLOW COMPARED WITH THE OTHER REGIONS. AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, 11.21\% OF CULTIVATED LAND, 14.23\% OF AQUATIC LAND, 12.06\% OF FORESTLAND, 9.70\% OF GRAZING LAND AND 13.04\% OF BUILT-UP LAND ARE EXPORTED THROUGH INTERNATIONAL TRADE. DESPITE THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ACCOMPANYING INTERREGIONAL LAND FLOW, VULNERABLE REGIONS WITH SEVERE WATER SHORTAGES MAY FACE A EVEN MORE CHALLENGING FUTURE IF THE CURRENT LAND TELECONNECTIONS STRENGTHEN.

EXPLORING THE ROLE OF THE PAPER INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF CONSUMPTION OF INTERMEDIATE INPUTS FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES MAY HELP TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE PRODUCTION OF PAPER DOES NOT ONLY GENERATE WASTE BY ITSELF BUT ALSO AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF WASTE GENERATED BY OTHER INDUSTRIES. THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) IS A USEFUL ANALYTICAL TOOL TO EXAMINE AND ASSESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OVER THE ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE OF A PRODUCT ``FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE'' BUT IT IS COSTLY AND TIME INTENSIVE. IN CONTRAST, ECONOMIC INPUT OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODELS (IO-LCA) THAT COMBINE LCA WITH INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IO) ARE MORE ACCURATE AND LESS EXPENSIVE, AS THEY EMPLOY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. THIS PAPER REPRESENTS ONE OF THE FIRST SPANISH STUDIES AIMED AT ESTIMATING THE WASTE GENERATED IN THE PRODUCTION OF PAPER BY APPLYING IO-LCA. ONE OF THE MAJOR BENEFITS IS THE DERIVATION OF THE CONTRIBUTION OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUPPLIERS TO THE PAPER INDUSTRY.

IN THIS STUDY WE ESTABLISH THE LINK BETWEEN BRAZILIAN DEFORESTATION AND PRODUCTION OF CATTLE AND SOYBEANS, AND ALLOCATE EMISSIONS BETWEEN 1990 AND 2010 ALONG THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN TO THE COUNTRIES THAT CONSUME PRODUCTS DEPENDENT ON BRAZILIAN DEFORESTATION. WE FIND THAT 30\% OF THE CARBON EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFORESTATION WERE EXPORTED FROM BRAZIL IN THE LAST DECADE, OF WHICH 29\% WERE DUE TO SOYBEAN PRODUCTION AND 71\% CATTLE RANCHING. THE SHARE EXPORTED IS GROWING, WITH INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS AND EMERGING MARKETS (ESPECIALLY RUSSIA AND CHINA) GREATLY INCREASING IMPORTS. WE FIND A CORRELATION BETWEEN EXPORTS (AND HENCE GLOBAL CONSUMPTION) OF BRAZILIAN CATTLE AND SOYBEANS AND EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION.

IN 2004, HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES REQUIRED MORE BIOLOGICALLY PRODUCTIVE LAND PER CAPITA THAN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, BUT THIS CONNECTION COULD ONLY BE IDENTIFIED WHEN LAND USED TO PRODUCE INTERNATIONALLY TRADED PRODUCTS WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, BECAUSE HIGHER-INCOME COUNTRIES TEND TO DISPLACE A LARGER FRACTION OF LAND USE.

IN LCA, THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF RESOURCE EXTRACTION AND EMISSIONS DURING A PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE IS QUANTIFIED. TO BETTER QUANTIFY THIS IMPACT, FIRST THE ALTERATION OF ECOSYSTEMS INDUCED BY THOSE PROCESSES NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR. SECOND, THE FLOW NETWORKS OF ECOSYSTEMS, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF THE EXTRACTED RESOURCES, SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE. TO ACHIEVE THESE TWO OBJECTIVES, A TOOL WAS SELECTED WHICH STUDIES THE FLOW NETWORKS OF ECOSYSTEMS: ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA). IN ENA, TOTAL SYSTEM INDICATORS ARE CALCULATED WHICH ASSESS AN ECOSYSTEM'S FUNCTIONING (E.G. CYCLING). ALTERATIONS OF ECOSYSTEMS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY CHANGES IN THE VALUES OF THOSE INDICATORS. ENA IS BASED ON THE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IA). THIS FRAMEWORK IS ALSO USED IN LCA ALLOWING FOR A POSSIBLE EXTENSION OF A PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE IN AN LCA WITH THE ECOSYSTEM FLOW NETWORKS OF ENA. THE ENA/IOA FRAMEWORK ITSELF WAS REVISED AND IMPROVED IN THIS STUDY TO BETTER FIT IN AN LCA FRAMEWORK, PRIOR TO INTEGRATION AND APPLICATION IN LCA.

PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT, A MAIN COMPONENT OF THE EF, REPRESENTS THE LANDS USED BY PRODUCTION SECTORS FOR PRODUCING THE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR THE FINAL CONSUMPTION OF A GIVEN HUMAN POPULATION. THERE HAVE BEEN, AT LEAST, TWO ALTERNATIVES IN ESTIMATING THE PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT. ONE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATES OF `APPARENT CONSUMPTION' OF EACH TYPE OF RESOURCE, ALONG THE LINE OF THE METHODOLOGY PROPOSED BY WACKERNAGEL AND PEES (WACKERNAGEL, M., PEES, W.E., 1996) AND ITS LATER REFINEMENT. THE OTHER, SUGGESTED BY BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) IS BASED ON THE MONETARY VALUES OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, THE INFORMATION RECORDED IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE FORMER FACES THE CHALLENGE OF DISTINGUISHING THE COMMODITIES USED AS INTERMEDIATE INPUT FROM THOSE AS FINAL CONSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH ITS RECENT DEVELOPMENT HAS TRIED TO CALCULATE THE RAW MATERIALS USED DIRECTLY IN TRADED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS (WACKERNAGEL, M., LEWAN, L., HANSSON, C.B., 1999A) IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB BECAUSE THE INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED. USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO CONSIDER THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS OF SUPPORTING FINAL DEMAND, MAY ALLEVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY. BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) ADOPTED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE FOOTPRINT OF NEW ZEALAND. IN THEIR CALCULATION, THEY USED LAND MULTIPLIERS TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCTION LAND AREAS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUTS FOR DOMESTIC FINAL CONSUMPTION DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AND PRESENTED THE ESTIMATES UNDER THREE LAND CATEGORIES, AGRICULTURAL LAND, FOREST LAND, AND DEGRADED LAND. HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION CAUSES ERRORS IN THE CONCEPT AND CALCULATION. THIS IS BECAUSE THAT THE AREA REQUIREMENT OF SECTOR J'S PRODUCTION LAND IS OBTAINED BY MULTIPLYING SECTOR J'S LAND MULTIPLIER WITH ITS OUTPUT FOR DOMESTIC FINAL CONSUMPTION. THE RESULT WOULD CONTAIN NOT ONLY SECTOR J'S OWN PRODUCTION LAND, BUT ALSO THOSE OF OTHER SECTORS WHOSE OUTPUTS SECTOR J USES AS INPUTS. THUS THE ENSUING ESTIMATES ON SECTORAL PRODUCTION LANDS CANNOT BE PRESENTED BY LAND CATEGORY. USING THE HYPOTHETICAL DATA IN THE ARTICLE OF BICKNELL ET AL.

HOWEVER, IN DEVELOPING NATIONS IN SOUTH AMERICA AND AFRICA (E.G., BRAZIL AND GHANA), THE DIRECT TIMBER HARVEST (248 MILLION M(3) AND 47 MILLION M(3)) IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE TIMBER HARVEST FOOTPRINT (222 MILLION M(3) AND 10 MILLION M(3)). EMERGING ECONOMIES (E.G., INDIA) HAVE ACHIEVED SIMULTANEOUS GROWTH IN THE DIRECT TIMBER HARVEST AND TIMBER HARVEST FOOTPRINT DURING 1990-2015, WITH AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATES OF 0.5\% AND 0.4\%, RESPECTIVELY. DEVELOPING NATIONS ARE MOSTLY NET EXPORTERS OF THE TIMBER EMBODIED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE (I.E., VIRTUAL TIMBER). THE DESTINATIONS OF VIRTUAL TIMBER FLOWS ARE MAINLY DEVELOPED NATIONS WITH ABUNDANT FOREST RESOURCES (E.G., THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN, AND GERMANY). OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTE TO IDENTIFYING CRITICAL NATIONS THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY DRIVE GLOBAL TIMBER HARVESTS THROUGH GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, BUT ALSO IDENTIFY THE NATIONS THAT HAVE SEVERE TIMBER HARVESTING PRACTICES DUE TO THE CURRENT TRADE MODEL. THE POLICIES RELATED TO FORESTRY SUSTAINABILITY SHOULD CONSIDER THE CARRYING CAPACITY OF FOREST RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING NATIONS, AND COMMIT TO BALANCING THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF FOREST PRODUCTS.

NEW COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN SET BY THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND ARE REFLECTED IN THE COUNTRY'S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC). THE BRAZILIAN NDC HAS THREE MAIN PILLARS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS: INCREASING THE SHARE OF BIOMASS IN THE TOTAL PRIMARY ENERGY SUPPLY TO 18\%, REDUCING DEFORESTATION, AND ACHIEVING 45\% OF RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE ENERGY MIX. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENLARGE THE SHARE OF BIOMASS IN THE BRAZILIAN ECONOMY, BUT IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON DEFORESTATION IN ORDER TO SET THE RIGHT STRATEGY EVENTUALLY. THIS STUDY IS THUS AN EFFORT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF A BIOBASED ECONOMY TO REDUCE BRAZILIAN EMISSIONS, CONSIDERING THE BROADER CONCEPT OF THE BIOECONOMY, USING BIOMASS FOR ENERGY, CHEMICALS, AND MATERIALS. TO SATISFY THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO ITS INTEREST IN ECONOMY-WIDE CHANGES IN FEEDSTOCK (FROM FOSSIL TO BIOBASED), COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODELING (CGE) WAS CHOSEN AS THE BASIC METHODOLOGY INTEGRATED WITH AN ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS (EIO-LCA). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE IMPACTS OF THE BIOECONOMY SCENARIOS ARE POSITIVE BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO REDUCE THE ESTIMATED EMISSIONS DRASTICALLY. EMISSIONS BY THE ENERGY SECTOR PRODUCE THE HIGHEST REDUCTIONS (7.5\%) BUT THE 12\% INCREASE IN THE LULUCF SECTOR OFFSETS THOSE REDUCTION.

A COMMON, BUT OFTEN NEGLECTED FEATURE OF THESE RESOURCES IS THEIR LOCATION DEPENDENCE. TO OPTIMIZE THEIR USE, FOR EXAMPLE IN BIOECONOMIC INDUSTRIAL CLUSTERS, THIS SPATIAL ASPECT SHOULD BE INTEGRATED IN ANALYSES. OPTIMAL DESIGN AND LOCALIZATION OF A BIOECONOMIC CLUSTER WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS BIOLOGICAL AND NON-BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR THE CLUSTER, THE COMPOSITION OF INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN THE CLUSTER, AS WELL AS THE DEMANDS OF THE OUTPUTS OF THE CLUSTER, IS CRUCIAL FOR PROFITABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY. WE SUGGEST THAT OPTIMAL DESIGN AND LOCATION OF BIOECONOMIC CLUSTERS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE USE OF A MULTICRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS (MCDA) IN COMBINATION WITH GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) AND OPERATIONS RESEARCH MODELING. THE INTEGRATION OF MCDA AND GIS DETERMINES A SET OF CANDIDATE LOCATIONS BASED ON VARIOUS CRITERIA, INCLUDING RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, ACCESSIBILITY, AND USABILITY. A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FLOW OF RESOURCES BETWEEN AND WITHIN THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IS THEN CONDUCTED BASED ON ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. THEN, THE CLUSTER LOCATIONS WITH THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL PROFIT, AND THEIR COMPOSITION OF INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES, ARE IDENTIFIED IN AN OPTIMIZATION MODEL. A CASE STUDY ON FOREST-BASED BIOECONOMIC CLUSTERS IN THE OSTFOLD COUNTY OF NORWAY IS PRESENTED TO EXEMPLIFY THIS METHODOLOGY, THE EXPECTATION BEING THAT FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE METHOD AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL COULD HELP DECISION MAKERS IN THE PLANNING OF A SMOOTHER TRANSITION FROM A FOSSIL-BASED ECONOMY TO A BIOECONOMY.",""

WE PERFORMED TWO ASSESSMENTS: A SIMULATION IN WHICH THE RATIO OF DOMESTIC TIMBER UTILIZATION IN JAPANESE WOODEN FRAMEWORK RESIDENTIAL INDUSTRY IS INCREASED BY 1\% ABOVE THE ACTUAL RATIO, AND A CASE ANALYSIS OF THE LEADING HOUSING COMPANY. T HOME. THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT INCREASING THE RATIO OF DOMESTIC TIMBER NOT ONLY HAD AN OVERALL ECONOMIC EFFECT BUT ALSO AFFECTED THE EARNINGS OF THE HOUSING MANUFACTURER IN SOME CASES. ON THE OTHER HAND, IN THE SIMULATION, INDUCED PRODUCTION INCREASED BY 4.49 BILLION YEN AND THE GROSS VALUE ADDED INCREASED BY 2.10 BILLION YEN IF THE RATIO OF DOMESTIC TIMBER UTILIZATION IN THE JAPANESE WOODEN-FRAMEWORK RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY INCREASED BY 1\% ABOVE THE ACTUAL RATIO OF 2018. THE RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION AND THE CASE ANALYSIS PROVED THAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS LARGER WHEN WOOD PRODUCTS ARE PROCESSED IN JAPAN, EVEN IF THEY ORIGINATE FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON FORESTRY IS LARGER WHEN LUMBER RATHER THAN EITHER PLYWOOD OR LAMINATED TIMBER IS USED.",""

CHINA'S LAND RESOURCES ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURES, AND THEREFORE LAND USE IS INCREASINGLY DISPLACED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THIS STUDY ANALYSES THE EVOLUTION AND DRIVING FORCES OF CHINA'S LAND CONSUMPTION FROM 1995 TO 2015. THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA'S LAND FOOTPRINT INCREASED FROM 8.8\% OF THE GLOBAL LAND RESOURCES UNDER HUMAN USE IN 1995 TO 15.7\% IN 2015. CHINA'S DOMESTIC LAND RESOURCES ARE MAINLY USED FOR SERVING DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION. MOREOVER, CHINA NEEDS TO IMPORT VIRTUAL LAND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO SATISFY 30.8\% OF ITS LAND DEMAND. AMONG THE THREE LAND USE TYPES OF CROPLAND, GRASSLAND AND FORESTS, GRASSLAND HAD THE LARGEST FRACTION IN CHINA'S LAND FOOTPRINT FROM 1995 TO 2000, WHILE FOREST HAS BECOME THE LARGEST ONE SINCE 2000. CHINA'S VIRTUAL LAND TRADE EXPERIENCED A SHARP INCREASE IN NET IMPORTS FROM 9.4E + 04 KM(2) IN 1995 TO 3.4E + 06 KM(2) IN 2015. OBSERVING CHINA'S VIRTUAL LAND NETWORK BY A CLUSTER ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT CHINA KEEPS TIGHT RELATIONSHIPS WITH AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, BRAZIL AND KOREA FOR ITS CROPLAND CONSUMPTION, AND CANADA, USA, MEXICO, AUSTRALIA, KOREA AND JAPAN ARE RELEVANT FOR ITS GRASSLAND CONSUMPTION. IN ADDITION, DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOW THAT AFFLUENCE IS THE MAJOR DRIVING FACTOR FOR CHINA'S LAND CONSUMPTION, WHILE CHANGES IN LAND USE INTENSITY COULD MITIGATE SOME OF THE RELATED EFFECTS. LASTLY, POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PROPOSED SO THAT CHINA CAN MOVE TOWARD SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT.",""
