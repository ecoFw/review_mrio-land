STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT LOCAL LAND-USE DRIVERS ARE LARGELY FROM GLOBAL SOURCES (E.G., TRADE INCREASES DEFORESTATION IN EXPORTING COUNTRIES). HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE LOCAL LAND-USE CHANGES AFFECT DISTANT LOCATIONS, NAMELY THE FEEDBACK BETWEEN THEM. YET THESE DISTANT IMPACTS AND FEEDBACKS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT FOR GOVERNING LOCAL LAND SYSTEMS. THE FRAMEWORK OF TELECOUPLING (I.E., SOCIOECONOMIC-ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DISTANT PLACES) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CONCEPTUAL TOOL TO STUDY INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE ASSOCIATED SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. HOWEVER, A SYSTEMS SIMULATION TOOL TO QUANTIFY THE TELECOUPLED CAUSES AND EFFECTS IS STILL LACKING. HERE, WE CONSTRUCT A NEW TYPE OF AGENT-BASED MODEL (ABM) THAT CAN SIMULATE LAND-USE CHANGES AT MULTIPLE DISTANT PLACES (NAMELY TEIEABM, TELECOUPLED AGENT-BASED MODEL). WE USE SOYBEAN TRADE BETWEEN BRAZIL AND CHINA AS AN EXAMPLE, WHERE BRAZIL IS THE SENDING SYSTEM AND CHINA IS THE RECEIVING SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOYBEAN EXPORTER AND IMPORTER RESPECTIVELY. WE SELECT ONE REPRESENTATIVE COUNTY IN EACH COUNTRY TO CALIBRATE AND VALIDATE THE MODEL WITH SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL LAND-USE CHANGES AND THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA. WE DESCRIBE THE MODEL FOLLOWING THE ODD+D PROTOCOL, AND VALIDATE THE MODEL RESULTS IN EACH LOCATION RESPECTIVELY. WE THEN ILLUSTRATE HOW THE AGGREGATED FARMER AGENTS' LAND-USE BEHAVIORS IN THE SENDING SYSTEM RESULT IN LAND-USE CHANGES IN THE RECEIVING SYSTEM, AND VICE VERSA. ONE SCENARIO EXAMPLE (I.E., A HIGH-TARIFF SCENARIO) IS GIVEN TO DEMONSTRATE THE RESULTS OF TEIEABM. SUCH A MODEL ALLOWS US TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF TELECOUPLING FEATURES AND THE INFLUENCE ON LAND SYSTEM SCIENCE, AND TO TEST HYPOTHESES ABOUT COMPLEX COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS (E.G., CASCADING EFFECT).",""

TO DEAL WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THESE INTERCONNECTIONS, THE `TELECOUPLING' CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK HAS EMERGED. THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK TAKES A COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEM APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS, CLASSIFYING THEM AS `SENDING', `RECEIVING' AND `SPILLOVER' SYSTEMS. THIS PAPER USES THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK TO INVESTIGATE HOW DISTANT SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTED THROUGH FLOWS OF ECO-CERTIFIED FORESTRY PRODUCTS AND DEMONSTRATES HOW THESE CONNECTIONS DRIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE AT THE RURAL PROPERTY LEVEL. WE IDENTIFY RURAL PROPERTIES WITH EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS IN PARAIBA VALLEY, SAO PAULO STATE, BRAZIL AS A SENDING SYSTEM, AND TRACE THE OUTGOING FLOWS OF CELLULOSE PULP TO RECEIVING SYSTEMS. CHINA AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ARE THE RECEIVING SYSTEMS, HAVING BEEN THE MAJOR IMPORTERS OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. USING A MULTITEMPORAL AND SPATIAL APPROACH, WE FOUND THAT BETWEEN 1995 AND 2005 RURAL PROPERTIES CONTAINING EUCALYPTUS PLANTATIONS WITH FSC CERTIFICATION HAD HIGHER RATES OF NATIVE FOREST COVER REGENERATION THAN PROPERTIES WITHOUT FSC CERTIFICATION. NATIVE FOREST CONSERVATION AND REGROWTH IN RURAL PROPERTIES IN PARAIBA VALLEY IS AN EFFECT OF THE TELECOUPLED SYSTEM BASED ON THE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND OF ECO-CERTIFIED CELLULOSE PULP FROM ELSEWHERE. ADDITIONALLY, WE FIND THAT THE TELECOUPLED SYSTEM ALSO RESULTS IN IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING AREAS IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST LANDSCAPES, WHICH WE IDENTIFY AS AN ADJACENT SPILLOVER SYSTEM.",""

THE TELECOUPLING CONCEPT IS ONE SUCH APPROACH: IT EXPLORES SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS AMONG COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS OVER DISTANCES. THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK IS THEREFORE WELL POSITIONED TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS TO PERSISTENT GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES. TO OPERATIONALIZE THE FRAMEWORK, WE HAVE DEVELOPED THE TELECOUPLING GEOAPP, A NEW WEB-BASED COMPONENT OF THE TELECOUPLING TOOLBOX THAT PROVIDES RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS WITH A USEFUL PLATFORM TO ADDRESS GLOBALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL TRADE, SPECIES INVASION, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, AND LAND-USE CHANGE. THE GEOAPP FEATURES MAPPING AND GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS TOOLS TO VISUALIZE AND QUANTIFY THE FIVE MAJOR INTERRELATED COMPONENTS OF THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK (SYSTEMS, FLOWS, AGENTS, CAUSES, AND EFFECTS). IN THIS PAPER, WE DEMONSTRATE THE GEOAPP'S FUNCTIONALITY BY APPLYING IT TO A CASE STUDY IN WHICH DISTANT SYSTEMS INTERACT ACROSS SPACE AND TIME: THE BRAZIL CHINA SOYBEAN TELECOUPLING. WE CONCLUDE BY HIGHLIGHTING THE ADVANTAGES OF THE TELECOUPLING GEOAPP IN ADDRESSING GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THIS WEB APPLICATION WILL BE VALUABLE TO A RANGE OF USERS EXPLORING TELECOUPLINGS AND OUTCOMES ACROSS DISTANT COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.",""

LOCAL DECISIONS, SUCH AS NEW ECONOMIC POLICIES OR DIETARY SHIFTS, CAN FOSTER CHANGES IN COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS ACROSS LONG DISTANCES. UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES IS ESSENTIAL FOR AGRICULTURAL-EXPORT COUNTRIES, SUCH AS BRAZIL. SINCE 2000, BRAZIL HAS LED THE EXPANSION OF SOYBEAN PLANTED AREA19 MILLION HECTARES, OR 47.5\% OF THE WORLD'S INCREASE. SOYBEAN IS AMONG THE MAJOR CROP COMMODITIES TRADED GLOBALLY. WE USE THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE (I) THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE DYNAMICS BETWEEN BRAZIL AND CHINA AS THE CAUSE OF THE INCREASED PRODUCTION OF BRAZILIAN SOYBEAN SINCE 2000; (II) AND THE CASCADING EFFECTS OF THE SINO-BRAZILIAN TELECOUPLED SOYBEAN SYSTEM FOR BRAZILIAN MAIZE PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS, WITH ATTENTION TO CONSEQUENCES ON DOMESTIC PRICES, AVAILABILITY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATIC EXTREME EVENTS. CENSUS-BASED DATA AT STATE AND COUNTY LEVELS, POLICY ANALYSIS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH PRODUCERS AND STAKEHOLDERS GUIDED OUR METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH. WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE BRAZILIAN SOYBEAN PRODUCTION DECREASED MAIZE SINGLE CROP PRODUCTION AND ACCELERATED MAIZE AS A SECOND CROP FOLLOWING SOYBEAN, A PRACTICE THAT MAKES FARMERS MORE VULNERABLE TO PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES (E.G., RAINFALL SHORTAGE). IN ADDITION, THE TWO-CROP SYSTEM OF SOYBEAN/MAIZE PRESSURES THE BRAZILIAN MAIZE MARKET WHEN UNEXPECTED EVENTS SUCH AS EXTREME DROUGHTS STRIKE AND WHEN THIS RESULTS IN A FAILED MAIZE HARVEST IN THE SECOND CROP, MOST OF WHICH IS FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION RATHER THAN EXPORT. OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THE NEED TO INCORPORATE THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK IN LAND USE DECISION-MAKING AND UNDERSTANDING LANDSCAPE CHANGES.",""

THIS IS LARGELY CAUSED BY TRANSNATIONAL MOBILITY AND MIGRATION, INTERNATIONAL LABOR, RESOURCE MARKETS, AND TRADE. UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMANS AND WILDLIFE, AND THEIR ASSOCIATED TELECOUPLING PROCESSES, HELPS TO PROMOTE BETTER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND GOVERNANCE FOR RECONCILING SOCIOECONOMIC AND CONSERVATION INTERESTS. EVEN REMOTE PLACES ON THE GLOBE EXHIBIT THESE FEATURES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA'S COASTAL AND MARINE ECOSYSTEMS, SEABIRDS ARE NOT ONLY VERY ABUNDANT AND CHARISMATIC MEMBERS OF THE WILDLIFE COMMUNITY, NOWADAYS, THEIR COLONIES ARE A MAIN TOURISM ATTRACTION OF GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND IN THE PAST THEY WERE USED FOR CONSUMPTIVE AND SCIENTIFIC PURPOSES THAT ALSO LINKED THE ``UTTERMOST ENDS OF THE EARTH'' WITH DISTANT PLACES. THUS, IN THIS STUDY, WE REVIEW HUMAN-SEABIRD INTERACTIONS IN THE ICONIC BEAGLE CHANNEL (BC) IN THE ARGENTINE PORTION OF THE TIERRA DEL FUEGO ARCHIPELAGO. WE ADAPTED AND EMPLOYED THE COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEMS (CHANS) APPROACH AND TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE DISPARATE SOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION AND OBTAIN A MORE HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT HUMAN-SEABIRD DYNAMICS AND TRENDS IN THE BC. ALTHOUGH OUR ASSESSMENT INCLUDES THE TEMPORAL SCALE OF HUMAN-SEABIRD RELATIONSHIPS, WE CENTERED THE CHANS AND TELECOUPLING ANALYSIS ON THE MODERN SEABIRD-TOURISM INTERACTION, FOCUSED ON THE CHANNEL'S ARGENTINE SECTOR, IN WHICH TOURISM IS MOST INTENSIVELY DEVELOPED. OUR SYNTHESIS OF THE BC'S TELECOUPLED CHANS ALLOWED US TO RECOGNIZE THE STRONG HISTORICAL LOCAL-TO-GLOBAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BOTH HUMAN AND NATURAL SUBSYSTEMS AND THE SHARP INCREASE IN DISTANCE TELECOUPLING DURING THE 20TH CENTURY. DESPITE THIS GLOBALIZING TREND IN SEABIRDS CONNECTING THE BC'S LOCAL ECOSYSTEMS TO DISTANT PLACES, IRONICALLY WE FOUND FEW LINKAGES BETWEEN ARGENTINA AND CHILE, DESPITE BOTH COUNTRIES SHARING POLITICAL SOVEREIGNTY OVER THIS SINGLE BIOGEOGRAPHICAL UNIT. RECOGNIZING AND STUDYING THE TELECOUPLINGS IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY WOULD HELP MULTILATERAL EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE THE SPILLOVER SYSTEMS (ESPECIALLY WITH CHILE) AND SENDING SYSTEMS (I.E., TRANSNATIONAL TOURISTS' COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN) INTO EXTANT REGIONAL POLICIES (E.G., STATE PROTECTED AREAS) AND GLOBAL INITIATIVES (E.G., THE UNITED NATIONS' SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS). IT WOULD ALSO ENABLE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS REGARDING SPECIFIC PROPOSALS BASED ON MARKET-BASED INCENTIVES (E.G., PAYMENT FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES), CERTIFICATION SCHEMES (E.G., DISTINTIVO ONASHAGA) AND PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES (E.G., COMANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES). INTEGRATING THESE SCALES INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BC WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT HUMANS CONTINUE TO ENJOY MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIS UNIQUE AND CHARISMATIC WILDLIFE AND AT THE SAME TIME REINFORCE RESPONSIBLE TOURISM AS A LOCAL-GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND GLOBAL CONSERVATION.",""

THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK GAINS ITS DISTINCTION BY ENABLING RESEARCHERS TO DIVE DEEPLY INTO SYSTEMIC COMPLEXITIES, EVEN IF SYSTEMS ARE FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. IT IS ALSO AMBITIOUS IN ITS AIM TO MEET CHALLENGES UNENCUMBERED BY DISCIPLINES. TO UNDERSTAND THE FORCES AFFECTING SUSTAINABILITY ACROSS LOCAL TO GLOBAL SCALES, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SPATIALLY EXPLICIT TOOLS FOR DESCRIBING AND QUANTIFYING MULTIPLE RECIPROCAL SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS OVER DISTANCES. WE INTRODUCE THE TELECOUPLING TOOLBOX, THE FIRST SET OF TOOLS DEVELOPED TO MAP AND IDENTIFY THE FIVE MAJOR INTERRELATED COMPONENTS OF THE TELECOUPLING FRAMEWORK: SYSTEMS, FLOWS, AGENTS, CAUSES, AND EFFECTS. THE MODULAR DESIGN OF THE TOOLBOX ALLOWS THE INTEGRATION OF EXISTING TOOLS AND SOFTWARE TO ASSESS SYNERGIES AND TRADE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH POLICIES AND OTHER LOCAL TO GLOBAL INTERVENTIONS. WE SHOW APPLICATIONS OF THE TOOLBOX BY USING TWO REPRESENTATIVE TELECOUPLING CASE STUDIES THAT ADDRESS A VARIETY OF SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE TOOLBOX CAN SYSTEMATICALLY MAP AND QUANTIFY MULTIPLE TELECOUPLINGS UNDER VARIOUS CONTEXTS WHILE PROVIDING USERS WITH AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE. IT IS OUR HOPE THAT THE INNOVATIVE, FREE, AND OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX CAN PROVIDE A USEFUL PLATFORM TO ADDRESS GLOBALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES, SUCH AS LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE, SPECIES INVASION, MIGRATION, FLOWS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND TRADE OF GOODS AND PRODUCTS.",""

ANTHROECOLOGY THEORY EXPLAINS THIS LONG-TERM DIFFERENTIAL SHAPING OF LANDSCAPES AS THE PRODUCT OF SOCIOCULTURAL NICHE CONSTRUCTION (SNC): AN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY COUPLING SOCIAL CHANGE WITH ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERING. THE EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMS UNDERPINNING THIS THEORY CANNOT BE TESTED WITHOUT EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES CAPABLE OF REPRODUCING EMERGENT SELECTION PROCESSES ACTING ON THE COMBINED SUITE OF CULTURAL, MATERIAL, AND ECOLOGICAL INHERITANCES THAT DETERMINE THE ADAPTIVE FITNESS OF HUMAN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS, AND SOCIETIES. AGENT-BASED MODELING, AS A ` GENERATIVE SOCIAL SCIENCE' TOOL, APPEARS IDEAL FOR THIS. HERE WE PROPOSE AN AGENTBASED VIRTUAL LABORATORY (ABVL) APPROACH TO GENERATING AND TESTING BASIC HYPOTHESES ON SNC AS A GENERAL MECHANISM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE BROADLY VARIED ANTHROECOLOGICAL FORMS AND DYNAMICS OF HUMAN LANDSCAPES FROM PREHISTORY TO PRESENT. WHILE MAJOR CHALLENGES MUST STILL BE OVERCOME, A PROSPECTIVE MODELING FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION, GUIDING QUESTIONS, AND ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES DEMONSTRATE CLEAR POTENTIAL FOR AN ABVL TO TEST PREDICTIONS OF ANTHROECOLOGY THEORY THROUGH GENERATIVE SOCIAL SIMULATION.",""
