THE QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH OF THE RESOURCE AVAILABLE IN CITIES IS EFFECTIVELY UTILIZED? IN RESPONSE, THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AN ECOLOGICAL-THERMODYNAMIC APPROACH TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF A SYSTEM TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND REDUCE THE DEMAND FOR NEW RESOURCES. IN THIS WORK, OPEN SYSTEM NETWORK EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS IS INTRODUCED AS A NOVEL ASSESSMENT METHOD TO INVESTIGATE THE CITIES' PRODUCER AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS BY STUDYING THE RESOURCE FLOW CONNECTIONS AND THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SECTORS. INVESTIGATION ON THE URBAN FLOWS NETWORK EVALUATES THE ABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO UTILIZE THE RESOURCE IMPORTED THROUGH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF UTILIZATION INDICATOR AND THE ABILITY TO CONVERT THE RESOURCE IMPORTED TO USEFUL PRODUCTS THROUGH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONVERSION INDICATOR. THE EFFECTIVENESS INDICATORS, UTILIZATION AND CONVERSION, REPRESENT THE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS TESTED THROUGH A CASE STUDY CONDUCTED FOR SINGAPORE CITY OVER THE TIME PERIOD 2005-2014. THE EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CITY, ON AVERAGE, HAS UTILIZED 45\% OF THE MAXIMUM EXTRACTABLE USEFULNESS FROM THE RESOURCES IMPORTED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, WITH THE LOWEST EFFECTIVENESS, 39\%, AND THE HIGHEST EFFECTIVENESS, 50\%, IN THE YEARS 2007 AND 2014 RESPECTIVELY. THE TRAJECTORY OF EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS SUGGESTS A TRADE-OFF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS TO BALANCE THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF RESOURCES IN THE CITY.",""

HOW TO APPRAISE AND IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY OF CHROMATE INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS NETWORKS IS STILL AN OPEN PROBLEM WHERE FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE ARE KEY APPROACHES TO SOLVE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE CHROMIUM AND CARBON METABOLIC BEHAVIOR OF A CHROMATE INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS NETWORK WITH ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AT INFRA-FIRM LEVEL. RESULTS SHOW THAT INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS REDUCES CHROMIUM SLAGS EMISSIONS AND IMPROVES RESOURCE UTILIZATION EFFICIENCY. INFLUENCED BY FLOW TYPE AND QUANTITY, THE CHROMIUM METABOLISM REALIZES MUTUALISM BUT THE CARBON METABOLISM FAILS DUE TO INTENSE COMPETITION FOR CARBON RESOURCE AMONG THE RECYCLING PROCESSES (THE ALUMINUM HYDROXIDE, SODIUM SULFIDE AND ALLOY STEEL PROCESSES). THE SODIUM DICHROMATE PROCESS IS THE LARGEST CONTROLLER ON THE CHROMIUM AND CARBON METABOLISM AND THE SODIUM SULFIDE AND ALLOY STEEL PROCESSES BOTH RELY ON CARBON RESOURCE SUPPORT OF THE SODIUM DICHROMATE PROCESS EVEN TO 100\% WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE INTENSE COMPETITION. UNDER DISHARMONIOUS CONNECTION PATTERN OF METABOLIC PROCESSES, STRUCTURAL DEFECTS BOTH OCCUR TO THE CHROMIUM AND CARBON METABOLISM. EVEN THOUGH, THE CHROMIUM METABOLISM IS CLOSED TO THE STABLE CONDITION WHILE THE CARBON METABOLISM STILL REQUIRES MORE NETWORK EFFICIENCY. OVERALL, THE COMBINATION OF CHROMIUM AND CARBON METABOLISM PROVIDE MORE DETAILS IN EXPLORING METABOLIC BEHAVIOR OF THE CHROMATE INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS NETWORK. THE APPLIED METHOD MAY BE HELPFUL TO REFINE MANAGEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION IN DEVELOPING INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS.",""

THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO TAKE GUANGDONG, CHINA AS A SPECIAL CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE THE INFLUENCE OF ENERGY CLASSIFICATION DIFFERENCES ON THE ENERGY METABOLISM SYSTEM. TO DO SO, WE INTRODUCED THE CONCEPT OF ``URBAN METABOLISM'' AND TREATED SECTORS AND ENERGY FLOWS AS NODES AND PATHS IN A NETWORK MODEL. WE USED THE INPUT OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO COMPILE THE PHYSICAL INPUT OUTPUT TABLE THROUGH THE EMBODIED ENERGY ELEMENT INTENSITY. BUILDING ON THIS, WE USED ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY THE URBAN METABOLIC PROCESSES AND ENERGY METABOLISM LEVELS WITHIN THE URBAN SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE ALTERNATIVE INDICATORS ARE FIRST INTRODUCED TO EXPLORE THE BEST ALTERNATIVE ENERGY IN VARIOUS SECTORS TO AVOID A SHORT-TERM ENERGY CRISIS. IN THIS PAPER, DIFFERENT ENERGY GROUPS ARE CONSIDERED ON THE ENERGY METABOLISM SYSTEM, INCLUDING ALL ENERGY, PRIMARY ENERGY, SECONDARY ENERGY AND SIX SPECIFIC ENERGY, WHICH WILL FILL THE RESEARCH GAP ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF ENERGY CLASSIFICATION ON URBAN ENERGY METABOLISM. IT IS FOUND THAT THE ENERGY METABOLISM OF GUANGDONG IS NOW IN THE STATE OF SUB-HEALTH. THE ENERGY METABOLISM HIERARCHY ATLAS SHOWS THAT THE PULLING FORCE IS HARDLY AFFECTED BY THE ENERGY CLASSIFICATION BUT THE DRIVING FORCE IS VERY SENSITIVE, WHICH FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THAT PRODUCERS CAN CHOOSE DIFFERENT ENERGY ACCORDING TO THEIR PRODUCTION STRUCTURE. FACING THE SHORTAGE OF ENERGY SUPPLY, THE SECONDARY ENERGY WITH THE HIGHEST SUBSTITUTABILITY OF ALL ENERGY VALUE IS THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE ENERGY FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING SECTOR (CONTAINING TWELVE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS MANUFACTURE OF TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF METAL PRODUCTS). MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE NONRENEWABLE PROPERTIES OF PRIMARY ENERGY MAKE IT PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO FIND THE CORRESPONDING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY. HEAT IS THE BEST ALTERNATIVE ENERGY FOR CRUDE OIL, WHILE ELECTRICITY IS IRREPLACEABLE. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE RESULTS WILL PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT TO GUIDE THE REFORM OF URBAN ENERGY METABOLIC SYSTEM IN AN ATTEMPT TO COORDINATE THE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY, IMPROVE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE AND MAINTAIN ENERGY SECURITY AND STABILITY.

A CASE STUDY EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMBODIED CARBON STRUCTURE AND PRODUCTION-BASED CARBON INTENSITY IN CHINA. RESULTS SHOWED THAT MOST WEALTHY PROVINCES WERE LESS CARBON-INTENSIVE WITH EMBODIED CARBON FLOWS BEING DISPERSED ACROSS THE NETWORK. THIS PRODUCED A NEED FOR DECENTRALIZED CARBON MITIGATION MEASURES. DEVELOPED REGIONS HAD HIGHER PRODUCTION-BASED CARBON INTENSITIES WITH MOST EMBODIED CARBON FLOWS AGGREGATED IN A FEW PATHWAYS. THIS INDICATED THAT ONLY PARTS OF THE ECONOMIC SECTOR WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN PRODUCTS EXPORTED TO OTHER REGIONS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE A CENTRALIZED DECARBONIZATION POLICY. THE PROPOSED INFORMATION-BASED ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS METHOD MAY HELP FACILITATE RATIONAL MITIGATION STRATEGIES BASED ON THE SPECIFIC CARBON EMISSION STRUCTURES OF VARIOUS REGIONS.

TO EVALUATE THE WATER-RELATED IMPACTS OF ENERGY-RELATED DECISIONS, WE BUILT A NATIONAL ENERGY WATER NEXUS SCENARIO ANALYSIS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK BY EXTENDING INPUT OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IOA) TO FUTURE ENERGY MIX SCENARIOS OF CHINA. THE SCENARIOS FOR CHINA OUT TO 2050 INCLUDE FOUR LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS THAT ARE PLANNED IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ROADMAPS AND ONE BASELINE SCENARIO. SECTORAL DIRECT ENERGY, DIRECT WATER, WATER-RELATED ENERGY, AND ENERGY-RELATED WATER CONSUMPTION WERE INVENTORIED. SECTORAL EMBODIED CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ENERGY AND THEIR INTER-SECTOR FLOWS WERE MAPPED USING IOA TO CREATE ENERGY WATER NEXUS NETWORKS. A SECTORAL NEXUS WAS DEFINED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE ENERGY WATER LINKAGE ON ENERGY AND WATER SYSTEMS. SECTORAL CONTROL AND DEPENDENCE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REVEALED BY ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT NEXUS IMPACT ON THE WATER SYSTEM WAS LARGER THAN THAT ON THE ENERGY SYSTEM. THE MAIN EXPORT AND IMPORT PAIRS-CHEMICAL INDUSTRY-AGRICULTURE (AG), MANUFACTURING-AG, AG METAL SMELTING AND PRESSING (ME), AND ME-ELECTRICITY (EL) SHOULD BE CRITICAL PATHWAYS FOR NEXUS MANAGEMENT VIA THE ADJUSTMENT OF SECTORAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS. THE SECTORS WITH A HIGH NEXUS IMPACT-AG, EL, AND ME-SHOULD DECREASE THEIR ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION TO ACHIEVE OUTSIZED SYSTEM-WIDE SAVINGS. SECTORS WITH A LOW NEXUS IMPACT SUCH AS DOMESTIC SERVICES; TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND POST SERVICES; AND WATER PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY-CAN INCREASE THEIR ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION WITH A LESSER IMPACT ON THE WIDER SYSTEM. THE LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO EXHIBITED THE LOWEST NEXUS IMPACT, FOLLOWED BY THE ENHANCED LOW-CARBON SCENARIO, WHOSE ENERGY MIX ALSO EXERTED THE LOWEST PRESSURE ON THE WATER SYSTEM.

EUROPE CHANGES FROM A BENEFICIARY IN DIRECT MUTUAL RELATIONSHIPS TO A CONTRIBUTOR IN INTEGRAL UTILITY MUTUAL RELATIONSHIPS, WHEREAS AUSTRALIA HAS AN OPPOSITE CHANGE. ALTHOUGH CHINA HAS A DOMINANT POSITION IN DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS, IT BECOMES AN EQUAL COMPETITOR WITH THE USA IN UTILITY MUTUAL RELATIONSHIPS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN AGGLOMERATION HAS PROMOTED ENERGY TRANSMISSION AND TRANSFERENCE WITHIN THE URBAN SYSTEM. THEREFORE, IDENTIFYING THE MECHANISMS OF ENERGY FLOW PROCESSES WITHIN THE AGGLOMERATION IS IMPORTANT FOR INTEGRATED AND SUSTAINABLE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. USING THE CONCEPT OF ``URBAN METABOLISM'' WE CONSTRUCTED AN 18-SECTOR NETWORK MODEL THAT REPRESENTED SECTORS AND ENERGY FLOW AS NODES AND PATHWAYS, RESPECTIVELY. NEXT, BASED ON THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE OF CHINA IN 2010, WE CONVERTED MONETARY VALUES INTO PHYSICAL UNITS. THEN, BY COMBINING THESE PHYSICAL UNITS WITH ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, WE DETAILED ENERGY FLOW PROCESSES AND CALCULATED ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON SECTORAL AND REGIONAL SCALES. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF ENERGY WAS CONSUMED BY INDUSTRY. BEIJING WAS THE DOMINANT INTEGRATED ENERGY CONSUMER, AND MOST OF THIS ENERGY WAS CONSUMED BY THE OTHER SERVICES SECTOR. FURTHERMORE, THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SECTOR, AND THE OTHER SERVICES SECTOR IN BEIJING, AND THE INDUSTRY SECTORS IN TIANJIN AND HEBEI, WERE CORE SECTORS IN THE AGGLOMERATION. TIANJIN AND HEBEI WERE NET ENERGY EXPORTERS, WHILE BEIJING ACTED AS A NET IMPORTER.

USING MARKOV ANALYSIS, STEREOTYPY INDICES, AND A NOVEL APPLICATION OF ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS, WE FOUND HIGH VARIABILITY IN THESE SEQUENCES. FIFTEEN COURTSHIP BEHAVIORS WERE DESCRIBED AND 96 BEHAVIORAL TRANSITIONS WERE OBSERVED, 39 OF WHICH OCCURRED ONLY ONCE. THE NUMBER OF COURTSHIP BOUTS RANGED FROM ONE TO TEN, THE NUMBER OF BEHAVIORAL TRANSITIONS RANGED FROM FOUR TO 41, AND THE NUMBER OF COPULATION ATTEMPTS RANGED FROM ONE TO 29. ONLY 23\% OF MALES USED A COMMON, SIMPLE BEHAVIORAL SEQUENCE. FEMALES EXHIBITED ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION BEHAVIORS IN 40\% OF THE SEQUENCES, BUT THESE DID NOT EXPLAIN THE HIGH VARIABILITY IN MALE COURTSHIP SEQUENCES. ABOUT HALF OF THE TRANSITIONS OCCURRED NON-RANDOMLY, AND STEREOTYPY WAS LOW. NETWORK ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE COURTSHIP SEQUENCES STARTED AND ENDED WITH STEREOTYPED BEHAVIORS AND THE HIGH VARIABILITY OCCURRED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEQUENCES.

IN THIS PAPER, EMBODIED EMISSION OF PM2.5 FROM EACH SECTOR OF BEIJING IS QUANTIFIED BASED ON INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (LOA). FORTY-TWO ECONOMIC SECTORS FROM THE INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE ARE AGGREGATED INTO FIFTEEN COMPONENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE MUTUAL INTERACTIONS AND CONTROL RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THOSE SECTORS HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY USING ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA) TO IDENTIFY THE DOMINANT SECTORS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN 2010, 34\% OF THE TOTAL PM2.5 EMISSIONS, OR 59.4 KT PM2.5, WERE INDIRECT EMISSIONS TRADED THROUGH ECONOMIC SECTORS WITHIN BEIJING. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF ENA, WE FOUND THAT ``SMELTING \& PRESSING OF METALS'' ``METAL PRODUCTS'' AND ``NONMETAL MINERAL PRODUCTS'' ARE THE TOP THREE SECTORS WITH THE HIGHEST CONTROL LEVELS WHILE ``AGRICULTURE'' ``CATERING SERVICES'' AND ``RESIDENTIAL SERVICES'' ARE THE LOWEST-RANKING SECTORS AMONG THE SYSTEM.

WHILE ECOSYSTEM NETWORKS GENERALLY TRACE A THERMODYNAMICALLY CONSERVED UNIT THROUGH THE SYSTEM, THERE APPEAR TO BE SEVERAL MODEL CLASSES. FOR EXAMPLE, TROPHIC (TRO) NETWORKS ARE BUILT AROUND A FOOD WEB, USUALLY FOLLOW ENERGY OR CARBON, AND ARE THE MOST ABUNDANT MODELS IN THE LITERATURE. BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLING (BGC) NETWORKS TRACE NUTRIENTS LIKE NITROGEN OR PHOSPHORUS AND TEND TO HAVE MORE AGGREGATED NODES, LESS DISSIPATION, AND MORE RECYCLING THAN TRO. WE TESTED (1) THE HYPOTHESIZED GENERALITY OF THE PROPERTIES IN BGC NETWORKS AND (2) THAT THE PROPERTIES TEND TO BE MORE STRONGLY EXPRESSED IN BGC NETWORKS THAN IN THE TRO NETWORKS DUE TO INCREASED RECYCLING. WE COMPARED THE PROPERTIES IN 22 BIOGEOCHEMICAL AND 51 TROPHIC ECOSYSTEM NETWORKS FROM THE LITERATURE USING ENAR, AND EVALUATED THE ROBUSTNESS OF THESE RESULTS WITH AN UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS.

FIRST, IT SHOWS THAT THROUGHFLOW (T-J), THE TOTAL ENERGY OR MATTER ENTERING OR EXITING A SYSTEM COMPONENT, IS A GLOBAL INDICATOR OF THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF THE COMPONENT TO THE WHOLE SYSTEM ACTIVITY.
