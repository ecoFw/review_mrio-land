UNFORTUNATELY, NO RESEARCH EFFORTS AS OF NOW HAVE BEEN DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TOWARD UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVS) AND WATER DEMAND. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP BY ANALYZING THE WATER CONSUMPTION AND WITHDRAWAL IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED USAGE OF ALTERNATIVE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE UNITED STATES. 5 VEHICLE TYPES - INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLES (ICVS), HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES (HEVS), PLUG-IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES (PHEV20, PHEV40) AND BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES (BEVS) - ARE ANALYZED ACROSS 50 U.S. STATES WITH 3 DIFFERENT ELECTRICITY GENERATION MIX PROFILES: THE STATE-BASED AVERAGE ELECTRICITY GENERATION MIX, THE STATE-BASED MARGINAL ELECTRICITY GENERATION MIX, AND A HYPOTHETICAL ELECTRICITY GENERATION MIX CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF SOLAR-POWERED CHARGING STATIONS. THE WELL-TO-WHEEL (WTW) LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS IS USED FOR THE WATER FOOTPRINT CALCULATIONS. IN WORST CASE, BEVS MAY CONSUME UP TO 70 TIMES MORE WATER THAN ICVS. BEVS WITH SOLAR CHARGING HAVE THE LOWEST LEVELS OF WATER CONSUMPTION AND WITHDRAWAL AND CAN REDUCE TRANSPORTATION WATER FOOTPRINT BY UP TO 97\%. IN MOST OF THE STATES, THE MARGINAL ELECTRICITY GENERATION MIX HAS HIGHER WATER CONSUMPTION AND WITHDRAWAL VALUES THAN THOSE OF THE AVERAGE ELECTRICITY GENERATION MIX. IN PARTICULAR, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THE USE OF BEVS WITH SOLAR CHARGING FOR STATES WITH THE HIGHEST WATER STRESSED AREAS (CALIFORNIA (CA), ARIZONA (AZ), NEVADA (NV), FLORIDA (FL), ETC.), AND RECOMMEND THE INCLUSION OF INCENTIVES BY FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS FOR THESE STATES.

WHILE INPUT OUTPUT METHODS HAVE BEEN WIDELY APPLIED THESE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH APPLICATIONS AND THERE IS A GROWING USE OF MORE FLEXIBLE COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM (CGE) APPROACHES. THIS PAPER USES A MULTI-PERIOD SCOTTISH CGE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE SYSTEM-WIDE EFFECTS OF THE TEMPORARY TOURISM EXPENDITURE RELATED TO THE GLASGOW 2014 COMMONWEALTH GAMES. WE QUANTIFY THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR RESULTS TO MODEL SPECIFICATION, FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON HOW INVESTMENT AND CONSUMPTION DECISIONS ARE MADE AND SHIFTED OVER TIME TO ACCOMMODATE THE TEMPORARY TOURISM SHOCK. AS PART OF THIS ANALYSIS WE IDENTIFY THE PRE-ANNOUNCEMENT PERIOD THAT OPTIMISES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT. WHILST THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS APPLY TO A SPECIFIC EVENT, OUR RESULTS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR SIMILAR ANALYSES APPLIED TO MEGA EVENTS AND OTHER TEMPORARY PHENOMENA AFFECTING TOURISM EXPENDITURE, SUCH AS TERRORISM ATTACKS OR EPIDEMICS.

INTERREGIONAL TRADE OF TOTAL EMBODIED ENERGY USES APPROXIMATELY TRIPLED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2007, AND THE TOTAL TRADE VOLUMES IN IT WERE EQUIVALENT TO 38.2\% OF THE NATIONAL TOTAL DIRECT PRIMARY ENERGY INPUT IN 2002 AND 62.9\% OF THAT IN 2007, RESPECTIVELY. AMONG ALL THE EIGHT REGIONS, NORTHWEST, CENTRAL, NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST WERE THE INTERREGIONAL NET EXPORTERS AND DEFICIT RECEIVERS OF EMBODIED ENERGY IN CONTRAST TO EAST COAST, SOUTH COAST, NORTH COAST AND BEIJING-TIANJIN AS INTERREGIONAL NET IMPORTERS AND SURPLUS RECEIVERS. SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF NET EMBODIED ENERGY TRANSFERS CAN BE IDENTIFIED FROM CENTRAL AND WESTERN INLAND REGIONS TO EASTERN COASTAL REGIONS, AND THE CENTRAL REGION PARTLY SERVED AS A ``TRANSMISSION CHANNEL''. BY CONSIDERING THE INTERREGIONAL EMBODIED ENERGY TRANSFERS, REGIONAL ENERGY USE INVENTORIES CHANGED LARGELY, AND THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 2002 AND 2007 WERE EXPANDING. INDUSTRIAL POSITIONS IN DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND INHERENT ECONOMIC DRIVING FACTORS SUCH AS INCREASING REGIONAL CONSUMPTION LEVEL, ACCELERATED INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RAPIDLY EXPANDING EXPORT WERE THE MAJOR DRIVING FORCES FOR THE EMBODIED ENERGY TRANSFERS AMONG REGIONS. TO FORM A SET OF USEFUL TOOL FOR CONTROLLING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ACHIEVING THE GOALS FOR ENERGY SAVING AND EMISSION REDUCTION, CHINA'S GOVERNORS AT ALL LEVELS DESERVE TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENERGY PRODUCERS AND USERS FROM THE VIEW OF DEMAND-DRIVEN ENERGY REQUIREMENTS.
