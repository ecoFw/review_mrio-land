ALSO, GLOBALIZATION HAS CATALYZED EVER-INCREASING INDIRECT ENERGY FLOWS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. IN ORDER TO PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF NATURAL GAS USE IN GLOBALIZED ECONOMY, THIS PAPER APPLIES THE SYSTEMS MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) ANALYSIS TO TRACK NATURAL GAS USE FROM PRIMARY SUPPLIERS TO FINAL CONSUMERS VIA THE LINKS BY PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, SUPPORTED BY TYPICAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR OF 2011. NATURAL GAS EMBODIED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS REVEALED AMOUNTING TO 2722.1 BCM, IN MAGNITUDE UP TO 90\% OF TOTAL GAS EXTRACTION FOR ENERGY USE, INDICATING THE INTENSIVE RELOCATION OF GAS USE BY TRADE. 83\% OF TRADED EMBODIED NATURAL GAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERMEDIATE TRADE, MAINLY FROM LEADING PRIMARY SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING RUSSIA, USA AND WESTERN ASIA, TO DOMINANT FINAL CONSUMERS, LIKE USA, EU27 AND EAST ASIA. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES ARE FOUND BETWEEN DIRECT AND EMBODIED NATURAL GAS FLOWS. CONSUMPTION-BASED RESOURCE EFFICIENCY CAN BREAK THE ILLUSION OF EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS, AND TRADE IMBALANCE IN TERMS OF GAS USE CAN BE OPPOSITE TO THE TRADE IMBALANCE IN CONVENTIONAL MONETARY TERMS. THIS PAPER HAS CONSTRUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TO TRACE NATURAL GAS FLOWS IN GLOBALIZED ECONOMY FOR THE FIRST TIME, AIMING TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS FOR POLICY MAKING.",""

IN MAGNITUDE, THE GLOBAL TRANSFER OF ARABLE LAND USE IS ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND 40\% OF THE TOTAL DIRECT EXPLOITATION. THE CONNECTIONS AS WELL AS IMBALANCES OF MAJOR ECONOMIES IN INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES OF ARABLE LAND USE ARE DISCUSSED. CANADA, AUSTRALIA, ARGENTINA, PAKISTAN AND AFRICAN REGIONS TURN OUT TO HAVE A MASSIVE DEFICIT OF ARABLE LAND USE IN BOTH INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES. IN CONTRAST, THE UNITED STATES, JAPAN, MAINLAND CHINA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY AND FRANCE OBTAIN A SURPLUS OF ARABLE LAND USE IN BOTH INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES BY LAND DISPLACEMENT IN THOSE NET EXPORTERS. INDICES IN TERMS OF ARABLE LAND USE SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATE BY SOURCE AND THAT BY SINK ARE DEVISED. FOR INDIA AS THE BIGGEST SOURCE REGION, AROUND 20\% OF THE ARABLE LAND RESOURCES EXPLOITED LOCALLY ARE FOR FINAL CONSUMPTION ABROAD. FOR THE UNITED STATES AS THE LARGEST SINK REGION, AROUND 40\% OF ITS ARABLE LAND USE ORIGINATES FROM FOREIGN REGIONS LED BY CANADA. FOR JAPAN AS THE BIGGEST NET IMPORTER IN BOTH INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES, OVER 90\% OF ITS ARABLE LAND USE COMES FROM FOREIGN ECONOMIES LED BY AFRICAN AND ASIAN REGIONS. FOR SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT, REGIONS ARE SUGGESTED TO BE MORE ADAPTED TO THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN BASED ON THEIR BEHAVIORS IN BOTH INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL TRADES OF ARABLE LAND USE.",""

THE BUSINESS CASE FOR SUPPORTING LOW-CARBON PRACTICES IS GATHERING PACE, ALONGSIDE THE REGULATORY DEMANDS IMPOSED THROUGH CARBON EMISSION COMPLIANCE REPORTING. DESPITE THIS, GUIDANCE FOR GENERATING CARBON FOOTPRINTS THROUGH HYBRID ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS IS UNDER-DEVELOPED AND UNDER-RESEARCHED. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ARE KEY COMPONENTS OF EDUCATION SYSTEMS ACROSS THE GLOBE, TRANSCENDING INTERNATIONAL BORDERS, SOCIO-POLITICAL REGIMES AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. AS AN INTERNATIONALLY SIGNIFICANT SECTOR BEGINNING TO ADDRESS CLIMATE ISSUES THROUGH CARBON REDUCTION POLICIES ON AND OFF THE ESTATE, VERY FEW RESEARCH ARTICLES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED THAT DOCUMENT EMISSIONS ARISING FROM ALL DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE ACTIVITIES. THIS STUDY OUTLINES A NUMBER OF KEY ELEMENTS TO STANDARDISE THE ORGANISATIONAL CARBON FOOTPRINTING PROCESS BY RECONCILING AND EVALUATING THE METHODOLOGICAL STEPS IN SIX SELECTED INTERNATIONALLY REPUTABLE GUIDELINES (PUBLISHED BY THE GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE, THE CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT, THE UNITED KINGDOM'S GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS, THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROTOCOL, THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDISATION ORGANISATION AND THE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING COUNCIL FOR ENGLAND). A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS UNDERTAKEN WHICH RELATES THE FOUR PRINCIPLES OF CARBON FOOTPRINTING (BOUNDARY-SETTING, IDENTIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES, COLLECTING OF DATA AND REPORTING/VERIFICATION) TO THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE. THEN, VIA CONSULTATION WITH UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT MANAGERS, A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE MADE TO ADDRESS AND IMPROVE I) THE POTENTIAL TO AVOID DOUBLE-COUNTING, II) THE FINANCIAL AND RESOURCE COST OF CARBON FOOTPRINTING AND III) THE RELIABILITY AND COMPARABILITY OF DATA COMPILED BY INSTITUTIONS. WE INTRODUCE A METHODOLOGY FOR A UNIVERSAL, STANDARDISED FOOTPRINTING STANDARD FOR HIGHER EDUCATION (THAT COULD ALSO APPLY TO ALL ORGANISATIONS REGARDLESS OF SECTOR OR REGION) WITH CUT-OFF CRITERIA THAT EXCLUDES PAID-FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TYPICALLY INCLUDED IN THE `SCOPE 3' PROPORTION OF THE FOOTPRINT. IN PROPOSING THIS METHODOLOGY, CARBON FOOTPRINTING IS MADE MORE APPLICABLE TO HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS (SINCE EXISTING STANDARDS ARE DESIGNED FOR GENERALITY AND FOR PROFIT-DRIVEN ORGANISATIONS) AND THE PRACTICAL ISSUES, ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNALLY OWNED DATA AND NON EXPERT STAFF, ARE BROADLY OVERCOME.

MOREOVER, THE CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN TOURISM AND ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS LONG BEEN A SUBJECT OF INTEREST IN MANY STUDIES, WITH NO UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT ON THE DIRECTION OF CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE TWO VARIABLES. THE MAIN ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD ON THE DIRECTION OF CAUSALITY ARE: FIRSTLY, THAT TOURISM CAUSES ECONOMIC GROWTH (TOURISM-LED GROWTH HYPOTHESIS); AND SECONDLY, THAT IT IS ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT LEADS TO THE GROWTH OF THE TOURISM SECTOR (GROWTH-LED TOURISM HYPOTHESIS). IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW SOME OF THE PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED, IN ORDER TO EXAMINE THE CAUSALITY BETWEEN TOURISM-SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THESE STUDIES HAVE USED TIME SERIES DATA ANALYSIS, PANEL/CROSS SECTIONAL DATA ANALYSIS AS WELL AS INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS. OUR EMPIRICAL LITERATURE REVIEW SHOWS THAT THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOURISM AND ECONOMIC GROWTH DIFFERS FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY; AND IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE METHODOLOGY USED.

BUT ALL PRODUCTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH FINAL CONSUMPTION, AND RECENTLY MANY STUDIES HAVE ALSO BEEN DEDICATED TO FINAL CONSUMPTION. THIS ARTICLE COMPREHENSIVELY REVIEWS THE BIOPHYSICAL ASSESSMENT OF HOUSEHOLDS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY REQUIRED AND EMISSIONS AND WASTES RESULTING FROM HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION PATTERNS. ALTHOUGH THE AGGREGATION BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL VARIABILITY MAKE COMPARISONS DIFFICULT, SOME PATTERNS CAN BE RECOGNIZED. RESULTS SHOW THAT FOR MANY ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) AND A FEW DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, HOUSEHOLD METABOLISM HAS BEEN MAINLY ASSESSED FROM THE ENERGETIC PERSPECTIVE, STRESSING HOUSEHOLD RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE EFFECT GASES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. FEW STUDIES DEAL WITH OTHER EMISSIONS AND WASTES. THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, TOO. ENVIRONMENTAL INPUT-OUTPUT (I-O) ANALYSIS AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT ARE THE METHODS USUALLY EMPLOYED, TOGETHER WITH THE USE OF ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND EXPENDITURE INFORMATION. INFORMATION ABOUT DIRECT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS IS COMPLEMENTED WITH DATA ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES. MULTIREGIONAL I-O TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED TO CAPTURE UPSTREAM REQUIREMENTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID ERRORS OWING TO TRUNCATION AND DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY ASSUMPTIONS. HOUSING, FOOD, AND MOBILITY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSUMPTION CATEGORIES, BUT THE SHARES OF THESE CATEGORIES IN THE REQUIREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIOECONOMIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS.

GLOBAL TRADE LEADS TO TELECOUPLING BETWEEN THE LAND USE OF PRODUCTION AND THE CONSUMPTION OF BIOMASS-BASED GOODS AND SERVICES. TELECOUPLING IS CAPTURED BY ACCOUNTS OF THE UPSTREAM LAND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRADED PRODUCTS, ALSO COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS LAND FOOTPRINTS. THESE ACCOUNTS FACE CHALLENGES IN TWO MAIN AREAS: (1) THE ALLOCATION OF LAND TO PRODUCTS TRADED AND CONSUMED AND (2) THE METRICS TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES IN LAND QUALITY AND LAND-USE INTENSITY. FOR TWO MAIN FAMILIES OF ACCOUNTING APPROACHES (BIOPHYSICAL, FACTOR-BASED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS), THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES AND COMPARES RESULTS FOR LAND FOOTPRINTS. BIOPHYSICAL APPROACHES ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE A LARGE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND DIFFERENT LAND USES, BUT SUFFER FROM A TRUNCATION PROBLEM. ECONOMIC APPROACHES SOLVE THE TRUNCATION PROBLEM, BUT ARE HAMPERED BY THE LIMITED DISAGGREGATION OF SECTORS AND PRODUCTS. IN LIGHT OF THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES, THE OVERALL SIMILARITY OF RESULTS GENERATED BY BOTH TYPES OF APPROACHES IS REMARKABLE. DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED RESULTS FOR SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF BIOMASS-BASED PRODUCTS, HOWEVER, MAKE INTERPRETATION DIFFICULT. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO PROVIDE CLARITY ON SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTUAL ISSUES OF ACCOUNTING FOR LAND FOOTPRINTS.",""

IN MANY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LIVING STANDARDS IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE ACCELERATING DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR ECONOMIES HAS RESULTED IN A DISPROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD ENERGY CONSUMPTION. THEREFORE, A MAJOR REDUCTION IN HOUSEHOLD CARBON EMISSIONS (HCES) IS ESSENTIAL IF GLOBAL CARBON REDUCTION TARGETS ARE TO BE MET. TO DO THIS, MAJOR ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) STATES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED POLICIES TO ALLEVIATE THE NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIORS AND LESS CARBON-INTENSIVE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO PROPOSED TO PROMOTE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY FURTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS CAN BE CONTEMPLATED, THOUGH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL CAUSES OF SUCH LARGE HCES AND HELP RESEARCHERS BOTH GAIN DEEP INSIGHTS INTO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESEARCH DOMAIN AND IDENTIFY VALUABLE RESEARCH TOPICS FOR FUTURE STUDY.
