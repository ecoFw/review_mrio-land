IN LARGE ENSEMBLES OF THREE GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS, DIRECT CO2 FORCING PRODUCES A WAVENUMBER 5 STATIONARY WAVE OVER THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IN SUMMER. SEA SURFACE WARMING PRODUCES A SIMILAR WAVE, BUT WITH THE OPPOSITE SIGN. THE WAVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE COUPLED MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT PHASE 5 ENSEMBLE WITH OPPOSITE SIGNS DUE TO DIRECT CO2 AND SEA SURFACE WARMING. ANALYSES OF TROPICAL PRECIPITATION CHANGES AND EQUIVALENT POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE CHANGES AND THE RESULTS FROM A SIMPLE BAROTROPIC MODEL SHOW THAT THE WAVE IS FORCED FROM THE TROPICS. KEY FORCING LOCATIONS ARE THE WESTERN ATLANTIC, EASTERN ATLANTIC AND IN THE INDIAN OCEAN JUST OFF THE EAST COAST OF AFRICA. THE STATIONARY WAVE HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON REGIONAL TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SUMMER, EXPLAINING SOME OF THE DIRECT EFFECT THAT CO2 CONCENTRATION HAS ON TEMPERATURE EXTREMES. ULTIMATELY, THE CLIMATE SENSITIVITY AND FUTURE CHANGES IN THE LAND-SEA TEMPERATURE CONTRAST WILL DICTATE THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE OPPOSING EFFECTS ON REGIONAL CHANGES IN MEAN AND EXTREME TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE.",""

WE EXPLORE THE IMPACTS OF SHIFTING IMPORTS TO THE COUNTRIES WITH LOWEST IMPACT INTENSITIES PER M(SIC) ACCORDING TO FOUR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES (CARBON EMISSIONS, MATERIALS, WATER, AND LAND), USING ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED MULTI REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (EEMRIO) ANALYSIS. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS OF EEMRIO ANALYSIS (THE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX HOMOGENEITY ASSUMPTIONS), WHICH WE DISCUSS IN THE PAPER. WE FIND THAT A LIMITED SET OF 13 PRODUCTS, AMONG WHICH FOOD PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS WHICH ARE NOT ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIED (N.E.C.), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN HALF OF ALL IMPACTS EMBODIED IN IMPORTS FOR EACH PRESSURE. EXCEPT FOR A FEW PRODUCT GROUPS, OPTIMIZING SOURCING AS TO MINIMIZE IMPACT FOR ONE PRESSURE REDUCES IMPACT IN ALL OTHERS. THE PRESSURE EXHIBITING THE HIGHEST SCOPE FOR OPTIMIZATION IS WATER.

THE LOSS OF THE MOST FERTILE LAND OWING TO URBAN EXPANSION, INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER DRIVERS, HAS BECOME A PRIME ISSUE FOR LAND SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SPATIAL PLANNING. SPATIAL PLANNING, BEING ABOUT BUILDING FRAMEWORKS TO GUIDE THE LOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURES, IS A MAJOR DRIVING FACTOR FOR MANY LAND-USE CHANGE PROCESSES. HOWEVER, RESEARCH ON THE POSSIBLE ROLES OF SPATIAL PLANNING IN HALTING THE INCREASING CONVERSION OF CROPLAND INTO URBANISED AREAS IS SCARCE. IN THIS PAPER, PLANNING INSTRUMENTS FOR CROPLAND PROTECTION CURRENTLY IN FORCE IN ELEVEN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE IDENTIFIED, AND DISCUSSED ACCORDING TO A FRAMEWORK CENTRED ON THE DIFFERENT FACTORS AND PREREQUISITES PROMOTING THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE COUNTRIES INVESTIGATED HAVE DEVELOPED A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FOR CROPLAND PROTECTION, WHICH CAN BE GROUPED INTO TWO ROUGH CATEGORIES: (I) PRIME PLANNING INSTRUMENTS, THAT IS PRIORITY AREAS FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE; AND (II) COMPLEMENTARY PLANNING INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE NATIONAL TARGETS TO LIMIT LAND-TAKE AND SOIL FUNCTION ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORKS. ADVISORY EXPERT PANELS AND PRE-EMPTION RIGHTS FOR FARMERS AND FARMING ORGANISATIONS ARE ALSO APPLIED COMPLEMENTARILY. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THESE INSTRUMENTS MIGHT BE MORE EFFECTIVE, IF THEY WERE LEGALLY BINDING ALL ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS AND PRACTICALLY APPLIED IN MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE CONCLUDE THAT EFFECTIVE CROPLAND PROTECTION REQUIRES THAT PLANNING AUTHORITIES COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF THE MOST FERTILE LAND.",""

RESEARCH TO DATE HAS ASCERTAINED THESE IMPACTS IN TERMS OF THREATS, BUT NOT ON SPECIES DIRECTLY. HERE WE USE A NOVEL APPROACH, BY PARAMETRIZING THE COUNTRYSIDE SPECIES-AREA RELATIONSHIP (SAR) (A).

IUCN HABITAT CLASSIFICATION DATA FOR ALL 22,386 MAMMAL, BIRD, AND AMPHIBIAN SPECIES, TO PROJECT ENDEMIC SPECIES EXTINCTIONS DUE TO HABITAT LOSS TO DATE ACROSS ALL 804 TERRESTRIAL ECOREGIONS; AND THEN, (C). VALIDATING THE PROJECTED EXTINCTIONS WITH IUCN RED LIST. WE ALLOCATE PROJECTED EXTINCTIONS TO THE AGRICULTURE, PASTURE, URBAN, AND FORESTRY AREAS USED, TRADED, AND CONSUMED IN 129 COUNTRIES, USING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED GLOBAL MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT DATABASE. RESULTS SHOW THAT FOR THE THREE TAXA COMBINED, A TOTAL OF 927 ENDEMIC SPECIES ARE PROJECTED TO GO EXTINCT DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF CURRENT GLOBAL LAND USE. THE TAXONOMIC BREAKDOWN IS 186 PROJECTED MAMMAL EXTINCTIONS, 170 BIRDS, AND 571 AMPHIBIANS, WITH GLOBAL AGRICULTURE LAND USE RESPONSIBLE FOR 267 PROJECTED EXTINCTIONS; PASTURE 314, FORESTRY 313, AND URBANIZATION 32. IMPORTANTLY, COUNTRYSIDE SAR PROJECTIONS COMPARE WELL WITH THE NUMBER OF EXTINCT AND THREATENED SPECIES DOCUMENTED BY THE IUCN RED LIST. WE FOUND THAT LAND USE FOR EXPORT PRODUCTION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 25\% OF THESE PROJECTED GLOBAL EXTINCTIONS. OUR APPROACH ENABLES PARAMETRIZATION OF COUNTRYSIDE SARS IN ANY WORLD REGION EVEN WITHOUT EXTENSIVE FIELD STUDIES, AND THEREFORE ALLOWS QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF BIODIVERSITY IMPACTS UNDER ALTERNATIVE LAND USE SCENARIOS.

ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL AND ORGANIC WASTES ARE PRODUCED THROUGHOUT THE FEWWN. OFTEN, THESE WASTES ARE NOT TREATED APPROPRIATELY BECAUSE THEIR TRUE COSTS ARE RARELY QUANTIFIED, AND USUALLY EXTERNALIZED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS SHORTCOMING IS ADDRESSED FROM A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE FUSED WITH APPROACHES FROM ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS. A REGIONAL BIOENERGY PRODUCTION MODEL WHERE BIOENERGY MAY BE PRODUCED FROM ETHANOL AND/OR AGRICULTURAL WASTES IS CONSTRUCTED. ECOSYSTEM SERVICE VALUATION METHODS ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE FRAMEWORK, ALLOWING FOR BIOENERGY PRODUCTION SYSTEMS TO BE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE AND/OR MAXIMIZE ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION. THESE VALUES ARE CAPTURED WITHIN A GREEN GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GREEN GDP) OBJECTIVE THAT VALUES BOTH ENERGY PRODUCED AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE VALUES LOST/GAINED. SYSTEM PROFIT IS ANOTHER OBJECTIVE IN THE MULTI-OBJECTIVE MODEL. THE FRAMEWORK IS APPLIED TO A BIOENERGY PRODUCTION SYSTEM FOR THE U.S. STATE OF NEW YORK, WHICH AIMS TO PRODUCE 10\% MORE BIOENERGY COMPARED TO ITS CURRENT LEVELS. NET CHANGES IN GREEN GDP RANGED FROM -\$16.5 M/Y TO \$90.6 M/Y, AND CORRESPONDING PROFITS RANGED FROM \$7.2 M/Y TO -\$74.5 M/Y. CORN GRAIN ETHANOL WAS THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF BIOENERGY IN SOLUTIONS WITH HIGHER PROFITS, WHILE ETHANOL FROM CORN STOVER AND BIOELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM ANIMAL MANURE BIOGAS CONTRIBUTED MORE BIOENERGY IN SOLUTIONS WITH INCREASING GREEN GDP. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE IS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN PROMOTING NATURAL CAPITAL/ECOLOGICAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL PROFIT. FEWWN SYSTEM DESIGN SHOULD CONSIDER THESE TRADE-OFFS MOVING FORWARD.

WE FURTHER EXPLORED RELATIONSHIPS AMONG VARIABLES USING SPATIALLY EXPLICIT SIMULTANEOUS AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS.

FOR EXAMPLE, 33\% OF TOTAL U.S. LAND USE FOR CONSUMPTION PURPOSES IS DISPLACED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. THIS RATIO BECOMES MUCH LARGER FOR THE EU (MORE THAN 50\%) AND JAPAN (92\%).

WESTERN EUROPE'S ``MIDDLE AGES'' (CIRCA 11-14TH CENTURY) MAY BE ONE SUCH CASE. BY THE 12TH CENTURY, MEDIEVAL EUROPE HAD SHIFTED FROM THE SUBSISTENCE AGRARIAN ECONOMY THAT EMERGED FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE TO ONE WHERE SPATIALLY DISPERSED TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES HELPED SUPPORT A COMPLEX SOCIETY THAT DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO CULTURAL WORKS. THIS SHIFT WAS FACILITATED BY NEW INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS CENTRED ON MONASTIC ORDERS THAT PROVIDED ACCESS TO BOTH NEW AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS TRADE ROUTES. THESE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO POPULATION GROWTH AND LAND CLEARING. ALL OF THESE FACTORS INCREASED THE WEALTH OF SOCIETY BUT ALSO CONCENTRATED THIS WEALTH IN A SMALL NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DEPENDENT ON AN EVER-INCREASING AND EXPLOITED HINTERLAND FOR RESOURCES.

THE INCLUSION OF THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM AS AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT DIMENSION IS ORIGINAL AND IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE IT IS THE LINK THAT CONNECTS THE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS.

THE STRUCTURE FUNCTION OBTAINED FROM THE COUPLED MODEL OUTPUT IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE SO-CALLED COLD OCEAN-WARM LAND (COWL) PATTERN BASED ON OBSERVATIONS, IN WHICH ABOVE-AVERAGE SPATIAL MEAN TEMPERATURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANOMALOUSLY COLD OCEANS AND ANOMALOUSLY WARM LAND. THIS PATTERN FEATURES MAXIMA OVER THE HIGH-LATITUDE INTERIORS OF EURASIA AND NORTH AMERICA. THE TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS AT THE TWO CONTINENTAL CENTERS EXHIBIT ALMOST NO TEMPORAL CORRELATION WITH EACH OTHER.

AS IN OBSERVATIONS, VARIATIONS IN THE POLARITY AND AMPLITUDE OF THIS STRUCTURE FUNCTION ARE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF SPATIALLY AVERAGED SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY. RESULTS FROM PARALLEL INTEGRATIONS OF MODELS WITH MORE SIMPLIFIED TREATMENTS OF THE OCEAN CONFIRM THAT THE CONTRAST IN THERMAL INERTIA BETWEEN LAND AND OCEAN IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE COWL PATTERN, WHEREAS DYNAMICAL AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS DO NOT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE.

IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ANALYZE TRENDS IN THESE LAND USES OVER THE LAST 57 YEARS IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATIC CHANGES TOWARD DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS. SINCE 1960, THE HUMAN POPULATION GREW FROM 80,000 TO 130,000; BUT THIS INCREASE LARGELY OCCURRED IN THE SCATTERED URBAN CENTERS, WHILE THE RURAL POPULATION DECREASED. THE MAIN LIVESTOCK-SHEEP-SHOWED A NET DECREASE OF AROUND 100,000 ANIMALS (-18.5\%), WITH NUMBERS INCREASING BETWEEN 1960 AND 1980 AND THEN DROPPING MARKEDLY. THE NUMBER OF MINING OPERATIONS DECLINED DURING THE 1970S AND 1980S AND THEN ROSE SHARPLY, REACHING A 30\% INCREASE SINCE THE 1990S. SIMULTANEOUSLY, STRUCTURAL WILD VICUNA POPULATIONS INCREASED FROM A FEW THOUSAND TO AROUND 130,000. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES OVER THE PAST HALF CENTURY INVOLVED A MAJOR WILDLIFE RECOVERY ASSOCIATED WITH A CHANGE FROM WIDESPREAD EXTENSIVE GRAZING TO INTENSIVE BUT SPATIALLY LIMITED IMPACTS AROUND MINING OPERATIONS AND GROWING URBAN CENTERS. TOURISM EMERGED AS A NEW ACTIVITY OVER THE LAST DECADES, BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS HAVE BEEN POORLY STUDIED. TO PROMOTE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGIONAL CONSERVATION, RESEARCH PRIORITIES SHOULD INCLUDE (1) EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF LAND USE CHANGES, SUCH AS GRAZING REGIMES SHIFTING FROM DOMESTIC TO WILD HERBIVORES, AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS OF MINING, TOURISM, AND URBANIZATION ON WETLANDS AND HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES; (2) MODELING OF FUTURE SCENARIOS OF MINING AND TOURISM EXPANSION AND RESULTING CONFLICTS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION; AND (3) COPRODUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INTERACTIONS AMONG LAND USES, CLIMATE CHANGE, AND THE DIFFERENT DECISION-MAKING AGENTS.",""

IN THIS STUDY, WE ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THIS PROBLEM WITH A SIMPLE LAND USE CHANGE SIMULATION THAT EXTENDS THE MODEL INTRODUCED BY MATHER AND NEEDLE IN 1998, AND CASE STUDY DATA FROM THE CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS IN POLAND. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AN ABRUPT INCREASE OF INTERACTION DISTANCE IS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE LAND USE DISPLACEMENTS BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF AREAL UNITS, RESULTING IN REVERSALS OF PREVIOUS LAND USE TRENDS AND FOREST TRANSITIONS. WITH INTERACTION DISTANCE EXCEEDING THE DIMENSIONS OF AREAL UNITS CONSIDERED IN THE ANALYSIS, THESE AREAL UNITS MAY BE CONSIDERED ARBITRARY, AND FOREST TRANSITIONS OCCURRING WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES SPURIOUS IN THE SENSE OF MAUP. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS FINDING MAY APPLY TO OTHER CONTEMPORARY COUNTRY-LEVEL ANALYSES OF FOREST COVER CHANGE, AND ARGUE THAT AT PRESENT, ONLY THE GLOBAL-LEVEL FOREST TRANSITION IS MAUP-INSENSITIVE, POSSESSING PROPERTIES RELEVANT TO ITS EARLY THEORETICAL MEANING.",""

FOUR FULLY COUPLED SIMULATIONS WERE PERFORMED: WITH AND WITHOUT LUCC FOR TWO SCENARIOS (RCP2.6 AND RCP8.5). MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GLOBAL LUCC EFFECTS ARE VERY SMALL BECAUSE OF OFFSETTING REGIONAL SIGNALS. FUTURE GLOBAL LAND-USE EMISSIONS DUE TO LUCC IN THE TWO SCENARIOS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 35.7 AND 32.1 PG C, RESPECTIVELY. THE LARGEST REGIONAL RESPONSES ARE DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAND COVER CONVERSION IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS. AS THE ALBEDO EFFECT DOMINATES IN MID- AND HIGH-LATITUDES, LUCC PRODUCES A SMALL COOLING OR LITTLE EFFECT IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND EURASIA AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION IN NEEDLELEAF EVERGREEN TREES. LUCC INCREASES TEMPERATURE BY 0.05-0.1 DEGREES C IN THE TROPICS DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN EVAPOTRANSPIRATION BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSION FROM RAINFORESTS TO CROPLANDS.

HOWEVER, FOR THE CO2 FLUXES, THE LUCC AND GHG/AEROSOL EFFECTS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND THE FORMER IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE LATTER OVER SOME REGIONS SUCH AS AFRICA AND SOUTH AND NORTH AMERICA.

IN SOME CASES HABITAT LOSS IS AN INADVERTENT OUTCOME OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION POLICIES INTENDED TO LOWER RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. WE RECOGNIZE THE TERM RESOURCE CONSERVATION AS MULTIFACETED, WITH A RANGE OF MEANINGS FROM PROTECTING WILDLIFE HABITATS TO EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATING AND USING MATERIALS AND ENERGY.

IN THIS STUDY WE ANALYSED DIFFERENT DIETARY SCENARIOS FROM A VIRTUAL LAND FLOW PERSPECTIVE, BASED ON REPRESENTATIVE CONSUMPTION DATA FOR GERMANY IN THE YEARS 2006 AND 1985-89. FURTHER WE IDENTIFIED THE CONSUMER GROUPS THAT WOULD HAVE TO ADAPT MOST TO BALANCE GERMANY'S VIRTUAL LAND IMPORT AND ANALYSED THE IMPACT REDUCED FOOD WASTAGE.

THE CONVERSION OF AGRICULTURAL RAW PRODUCTS TO CONSUMED COMMODITIES IS BASED ON OFFICIAL PROCESSING AND COMPOSITION DATA. SUBGROUP-SPECIFIC INTAKE DATA FROM THE LAST REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL NUTRITION SURVEY IN GERMANY WERE USED. WE ANALYSED 42 COMMODITIES, AGGREGATED INTO 23 PRODUCT GROUPS, SEVEN LAND USE TYPES AND SIX NUTRITION SCENARIOS.

IN THIS PAPER WE CALCULATE THAT THE RESULTING NET IMPORT OF VIRTUAL LAND COULD BE BALANCED BY WAY OF A SHIFT TO AN OFFICIALLY RECOMMENDED DIET AND A REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS (COCOA, COFFEE, GREEN/BLACK TEA, WINE). A SHIFT TO AN OVO-LACTO-VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN DIET WOULD EVEN LEAD TO A POSITIVE VIRTUAL LAND BALANCE (EVEN WITH MAINTAINED CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS).
