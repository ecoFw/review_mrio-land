CHINA'S LAND RESOURCES ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURES, AND THEREFORE LAND USE IS INCREASINGLY DISPLACED TO OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THIS STUDY ANALYSES THE EVOLUTION AND DRIVING FORCES OF CHINA'S LAND CONSUMPTION FROM 1995 TO 2015. THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA'S LAND FOOTPRINT INCREASED FROM 8.8\% OF THE GLOBAL LAND RESOURCES UNDER HUMAN USE IN 1995 TO 15.7\% IN 2015. CHINA'S DOMESTIC LAND RESOURCES ARE MAINLY USED FOR SERVING DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION. MOREOVER, CHINA NEEDS TO IMPORT VIRTUAL LAND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO SATISFY 30.8\% OF ITS LAND DEMAND. AMONG THE THREE LAND USE TYPES OF CROPLAND, GRASSLAND AND FORESTS, GRASSLAND HAD THE LARGEST FRACTION IN CHINA'S LAND FOOTPRINT FROM 1995 TO 2000, WHILE FOREST HAS BECOME THE LARGEST ONE SINCE 2000. CHINA'S VIRTUAL LAND TRADE EXPERIENCED A SHARP INCREASE IN NET IMPORTS FROM 9.4E + 04 KM(2) IN 1995 TO 3.4E + 06 KM(2) IN 2015. OBSERVING CHINA'S VIRTUAL LAND NETWORK BY A CLUSTER ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT CHINA KEEPS TIGHT RELATIONSHIPS WITH AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, BRAZIL AND KOREA FOR ITS CROPLAND CONSUMPTION, AND CANADA, USA, MEXICO, AUSTRALIA, KOREA AND JAPAN ARE RELEVANT FOR ITS GRASSLAND CONSUMPTION. IN ADDITION, DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS RESULTS SHOW THAT AFFLUENCE IS THE MAJOR DRIVING FACTOR FOR CHINA'S LAND CONSUMPTION, WHILE CHANGES IN LAND USE INTENSITY COULD MITIGATE SOME OF THE RELATED EFFECTS. LASTLY, POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PROPOSED SO THAT CHINA CAN MOVE TOWARD SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT.",""

WE FIND THAT A LIMITED SET OF 13 PRODUCTS, AMONG WHICH FOOD PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS WHICH ARE NOT ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIED (N.E.C.), IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN HALF OF ALL IMPACTS EMBODIED IN IMPORTS FOR EACH PRESSURE. EXCEPT FOR A FEW PRODUCT GROUPS, OPTIMIZING SOURCING AS TO MINIMIZE IMPACT FOR ONE PRESSURE REDUCES IMPACT IN ALL OTHERS. THE PRESSURE EXHIBITING THE HIGHEST SCOPE FOR OPTIMIZATION IS WATER.

CHINA HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING RADICAL LAND USE CHANGES SINCE ITS ECONOMIC REFORM IN 1978. THE QUANTIFICATION OF LAND TELECONNECTIONS IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING LAND-RELATED SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE LAND TELECONNECTIONS IN CHINA AT THE PROVINCIAL SCALE, USING A MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL AND THE LATEST DOMESTIC TRADE DATA IN 2012. IT IS FOUND THAT LARGE AMOUNTS OF LAND IN THE WESTERN PROVINCES OF CHINA ARE CONSUMED BY THE COASTAL PROVINCES. MORE THAN 90\% OF LAND CONSUMED BY BEIJING, TIANJIN AND SHANGHAI IS FROM OTHER PROVINCES. AGRICULTURAL LAND MAINLY TRANSFERS IN THE WEST-TO-EAST AND NORTH-TO-SOUTH DIRECTIONS. THE REGIONS IN NORTHEAST AND NORTHWEST CHINA HAVE THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND OUTFLOW COMPARED WITH THE OTHER REGIONS.

WE USE THE ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASE EXIOBASE IN A CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH TO ASSESS CARBON, LAND, AND WATER FOOTPRINTS OF FOUR INCOME GROUPS WITHIN EACH OF THESE EMERGING ECONOMIES IN 2050 COMPARED TO OUR BASE YEAR 2010. WE ESTIMATE THAT CONSUMPTION CHANGES MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCREASE BY A FACTOR OF 1.6 (FOR RUSSIA'S WATER FOOTPRINT) TO A FACTOR OF 7.0 (FOR NIGERIA'S CARBON FOOTPRINT). THIS RISE IS MOSTLY DRIVEN BY GDP GROWTH, BUT OFTEN ALSO BY POPULATION GROWTH. CHANGES IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS DUE TO INCOME GROWTH, HOWEVER, ATTENUATE THE EFFECT. THE ATTENUATION APPEARED TO BE MUCH STRONGER FOR WATER (FOR INDIA AND INDONESIA OVER 50\%) THAN FOR LAND OR CARBON FOOTPRINTS. IT IS HENCE IMPORTANT THAT FORWARD-LOOKING MODELLING EXERCISES ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT INCOME CATEGORIES AND RELATED EXPENDITURE PATTERNS. THE RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE HOWMUCH OUR TECHNOLOGIES MUST IMPROVE TO COMPENSATE FOR IMPACT INCREASES INDUCED BY RISING CONSUMPTION.

A MODEL-BASED APPROACH TO LAND-USE EFFICIENCY FOR TOURIST DESTINATIONS","IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS OF CENTRAL EUROPE, MANY SUCCESSFUL TOURIST DESTINATIONS FACE THE PROBLEM OF APPROACHING THE LIMIT OF THEIR GROWTH POTENTIAL. SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM COMMONLY REFER TO THE IDEA OF ``SMART GROWTH'' BASED ON INCREASING EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF NATURE FOR ECONOMIC PRODUCTION (ECO-EFFICIENCY). IN THIS PAPER, WE SHOW HOW ECO-EFFICIENCY CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE TOURISM STRATEGIES ON LOCAL SCALE BASED ON AN AUGMENTED REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL THAT DELIVERS INFORMATION ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, LAND USE (AS INDICATOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE), AND EMPLOYMENT. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS APPROACH VIA A CASE STUDY OF THE TOURIST DESTINATION OF DAVOS IN THE SWISS ALPS. THE MODEL PREDICTS THAT THE KEY DRIVERS OF LAND-USE EFFICIENCY ARE: (I) THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF TOURISTS, (II) OCCUPANCY INTENSITY, AND (III) THE DENSITY OF BEDS PER AREA COVERED BY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND HOTELS. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF INCREASING BED CAPACITY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE TOURIST CATEGORY TRIGGERING THE DEVELOPMENT; THIS CAN ALSO BE USED TO ATTRACT NEW TOURIST CATEGORIES AT THE EXPENSE OF TOURIST CATEGORIES THAT MAKE INEFFICIENT USE OF AVAILABLE LAND. AS THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASED DENSITY OF BEDS PER GROUND FLOOR AREA IS AS HIGH AS AN IMPROVED OCCUPANCY RATE OVER DURING THE YEAR, SPATIAL PLANNING, BUILDING DESIGN, AND FACILITY MANAGEMENT ALSO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN IMPROVING LAND EFFICIENCY IN THE TOURISM SECTOR.

THE LEGISLATION REFERS TO PRESSURES OCCURRING WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL BOUNDARIES OF A COUNTRY. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING IS THE CONSUMER APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTS FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION, WHEREVER THESE PRESSURES OCCUR. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SUCH AN APPROACH, IN WHICH CO(2) OR GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS ARE CONSIDERED FROM A CONSUMER'S PERSPECTIVE.

THE OTHER, SUGGESTED BY BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) IS BASED ON THE MONETARY VALUES OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, THE INFORMATION RECORDED IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE FORMER FACES THE CHALLENGE OF DISTINGUISHING THE COMMODITIES USED AS INTERMEDIATE INPUT FROM THOSE AS FINAL CONSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH ITS RECENT DEVELOPMENT HAS TRIED TO CALCULATE THE RAW MATERIALS USED DIRECTLY IN TRADED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS (WACKERNAGEL, M., LEWAN, L., HANSSON, C.B., 1999A) IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB BECAUSE THE INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED. USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO CONSIDER THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS OF SUPPORTING FINAL DEMAND, MAY ALLEVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY. BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) ADOPTED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE FOOTPRINT OF NEW ZEALAND. IN THEIR CALCULATION, THEY USED LAND MULTIPLIERS TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCTION LAND AREAS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUTS FOR DOMESTIC FINAL CONSUMPTION DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AND PRESENTED THE ESTIMATES UNDER THREE LAND CATEGORIES, AGRICULTURAL LAND, FOREST LAND, AND DEGRADED LAND. HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION CAUSES ERRORS IN THE CONCEPT AND CALCULATION. THIS IS BECAUSE THAT THE AREA REQUIREMENT OF SECTOR J'S PRODUCTION LAND IS OBTAINED BY MULTIPLYING SECTOR J'S LAND MULTIPLIER WITH ITS OUTPUT FOR DOMESTIC FINAL CONSUMPTION. THE RESULT WOULD CONTAIN NOT ONLY SECTOR J'S OWN PRODUCTION LAND, BUT ALSO THOSE OF OTHER SECTORS WHOSE OUTPUTS SECTOR J USES AS INPUTS. THUS THE ENSUING ESTIMATES ON SECTORAL PRODUCTION LANDS CANNOT BE PRESENTED BY LAND CATEGORY. USING THE HYPOTHETICAL DATA IN THE ARTICLE OF BICKNELL ET AL. (1998), THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE REASONS FOR USING THE COMPOSITION OF LAND MULTIPLIERS INSTEAD OF LAND MULTIPLIERS IN ESTIMATING THE PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT SO THAT THE CALCULATED AREAS CAN BE EXPRESSED BY LAND CATEGORY.

DIETARY PATTERNS IN PARTICULAR, EMBEDDED IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF FOODS AND OTHER BIOMASS BASED COMMODITIES, DETERMINE THE DIMENSION OF BENEFICIAL OR HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR - BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD. IN THIS STUDY WE ANALYSED DIFFERENT DIETARY SCENARIOS FROM A VIRTUAL LAND FLOW PERSPECTIVE, BASED ON REPRESENTATIVE CONSUMPTION DATA FOR GERMANY IN THE YEARS 2006 AND 1985-89. FURTHER WE IDENTIFIED THE CONSUMER GROUPS THAT WOULD HAVE TO ADAPT MOST TO BALANCE GERMANY'S VIRTUAL LAND IMPORT AND ANALYSED THE IMPACT REDUCED FOOD WASTAGE. FOR THE STUDY, OFFICIAL DATA SETS CONCERNING PRODUCTION, TRADE AND CONSUMPTION WERE USED. WE DERIVED LAND USE DATA FROM ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT DATA SETS AND FAO STATISTICS. THE CONVERSION OF AGRICULTURAL RAW PRODUCTS TO CONSUMED COMMODITIES IS BASED ON OFFICIAL PROCESSING AND COMPOSITION DATA. SUBGROUP-SPECIFIC INTAKE DATA FROM THE LAST REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL NUTRITION SURVEY IN GERMANY WERE USED. WE ANALYSED 42 COMMODITIES, AGGREGATED INTO 23 PRODUCT GROUPS, SEVEN LAND USE TYPES AND SIX NUTRITION SCENARIOS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN THE BASELINE SCENARIO THE AVERAGE NUTRITION IN THE YEAR 2006 LEADS TO A VIRTUAL LAND IMPORT OF 707 M(2) P(-1) A(-1) WHICH REPRESENTS 30\% OF THE TOTAL NUTRITION-INDUCED LAND DEMAND OF 2365 M(2) P(-1) ON THE OTHER HAND, THE GERMAN AGRI-FOOD SECTOR EXPORTS VIRTUAL LAND, IN THE FORM OF COMMODITIES, EQUIVALENT TO 262 M(2) P(-1) A(-1). IN THIS PAPER WE CALCULATE THAT THE RESULTING NET IMPORT OF VIRTUAL LAND COULD BE BALANCED BY WAY OF A SHIFT TO AN OFFICIALLY RECOMMENDED DIET AND A REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS (COCOA, COFFEE, GREEN/BLACK TEA, WINE). A SHIFT TO AN OVO-LACTO-VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN DIET WOULD EVEN LEAD TO A POSITIVE VIRTUAL LAND BALANCE (EVEN WITH MAINTAINED CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS). MOREOVER, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT A SHIFT IN THE AVERAGE DIET PROFILE COULD LEAD TO MAINTAINED OR EVEN EXPANDED EXPORT COMPETITIVENESS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENABLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS.

THE AMOUNT OF EMBODIED ARABLE LAND ASSOCIATED WITH SHANGHAI ECONOMY IS 6.09 MHA, BROKEN DOWN INTO LOCAL ARABLE LAND USE (0.20 MHA), DOMESTIC INFLOWS (3.20 MHA) AND FOREIGN INFLOWS (2.69 MHA). THIS AREA SUPPORTS LOCAL FINAL DEMAND (4.32 MHA), DOMESTIC OUTFLOWS (1.24 MHA) AND FOREIGN OUTFLOWS (0.53 MHA). LAND-RELATED IMBALANCES EMERGE IN THE STUDY, NAMELY THE ECONOMY'S DEMAND VERSUS THE CITY'S SIZE, THE ARABLE LAND DEMAND VERSUS SUPPLY, AND EMBODIED ARABLE LAND INFLOWS VERSUS OUTFLOWS. REGARDING THE ROLE OF THE URBAN ECONOMY IN ALLOCATION OF GLOBAL ARABLE LAND UNDER ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, ON THE ONE HAND, SHANGHAI HAS INTENSIVELY INVOLVED WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF EMBODIED FOREIGN ARABLE LAND RESOURCES, AND HAS BEEN HEAVY DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN EMBODIED ARABLE LAND; ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS STILL LARGE POTENTIAL FOR SHANGHAI TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION FOR AN OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF DIRECT AND EMBODIED ARABLE LAND. POLICY SUGGESTIONS ON TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION FOR AN OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF DIRECT AND EMBODIED AMBLE LAND ARE PUT FORWARD.",""
