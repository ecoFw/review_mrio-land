STUDIES HAVE CONCLUDED THAT LOCAL LAND-USE DRIVERS ARE LARGELY FROM GLOBAL SOURCES (E.G., TRADE INCREASES DEFORESTATION IN EXPORTING COUNTRIES). HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE LOCAL LAND-USE CHANGES AFFECT DISTANT LOCATIONS, NAMELY THE FEEDBACK BETWEEN THEM. YET THESE DISTANT IMPACTS AND FEEDBACKS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT FOR GOVERNING LOCAL LAND SYSTEMS. THE FRAMEWORK OF TELECOUPLING (I.E., SOCIOECONOMIC-ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DISTANT PLACES) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE CONCEPTUAL TOOL TO STUDY INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE ASSOCIATED SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. HOWEVER, A SYSTEMS SIMULATION TOOL TO QUANTIFY THE TELECOUPLED CAUSES AND EFFECTS IS STILL LACKING. HERE, WE CONSTRUCT A NEW TYPE OF AGENT-BASED MODEL (ABM) THAT CAN SIMULATE LAND-USE CHANGES AT MULTIPLE DISTANT PLACES (NAMELY TEIEABM, TELECOUPLED AGENT-BASED MODEL). WE USE SOYBEAN TRADE BETWEEN BRAZIL AND CHINA AS AN EXAMPLE, WHERE BRAZIL IS THE SENDING SYSTEM AND CHINA IS THE RECEIVING SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST SOYBEAN EXPORTER AND IMPORTER RESPECTIVELY. WE SELECT ONE REPRESENTATIVE COUNTY IN EACH COUNTRY TO CALIBRATE AND VALIDATE THE MODEL WITH SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL LAND-USE CHANGES AND THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA. WE DESCRIBE THE MODEL FOLLOWING THE ODD+D PROTOCOL, AND VALIDATE THE MODEL RESULTS IN EACH LOCATION RESPECTIVELY. WE THEN ILLUSTRATE HOW THE AGGREGATED FARMER AGENTS' LAND-USE BEHAVIORS IN THE SENDING SYSTEM RESULT IN LAND-USE CHANGES IN THE RECEIVING SYSTEM, AND VICE VERSA. ONE SCENARIO EXAMPLE (I.E., A HIGH-TARIFF SCENARIO) IS GIVEN TO DEMONSTRATE THE RESULTS OF TEIEABM. SUCH A MODEL ALLOWS US TO ADVANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF TELECOUPLING FEATURES AND THE INFLUENCE ON LAND SYSTEM SCIENCE, AND TO TEST HYPOTHESES ABOUT COMPLEX COUPLED HUMAN-NATURAL SYSTEMS (E.G., CASCADING EFFECT).",""

SPATIAL PLANNING, BEING ABOUT BUILDING FRAMEWORKS TO GUIDE THE LOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURES, IS A MAJOR DRIVING FACTOR FOR MANY LAND-USE CHANGE PROCESSES. HOWEVER, RESEARCH ON THE POSSIBLE ROLES OF SPATIAL PLANNING IN HALTING THE INCREASING CONVERSION OF CROPLAND INTO URBANISED AREAS IS SCARCE. IN THIS PAPER, PLANNING INSTRUMENTS FOR CROPLAND PROTECTION CURRENTLY IN FORCE IN ELEVEN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE IDENTIFIED, AND DISCUSSED ACCORDING TO A FRAMEWORK CENTRED ON THE DIFFERENT FACTORS AND PREREQUISITES PROMOTING THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE COUNTRIES INVESTIGATED HAVE DEVELOPED A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FOR CROPLAND PROTECTION, WHICH CAN BE GROUPED INTO TWO ROUGH CATEGORIES: (I) PRIME PLANNING INSTRUMENTS, THAT IS PRIORITY AREAS FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE; AND (II) COMPLEMENTARY PLANNING INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE NATIONAL TARGETS TO LIMIT LAND-TAKE AND SOIL FUNCTION ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORKS.

IN DOING SO, WE PERFORM INFRASTRUCTURAL INVERSION TO FOREGROUND THE BACKSTAGE SCIENTIFIC WORK PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY POINTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. WE USED THESE INSIGHTS REGARDING BREAKDOWNS AND WORKAROUNDS TO INFORM THE DESIGN OF GLOBE, INFRASTRUCTURAL TOOLS THAT SUPPORT THIS COMMUNITY'S NEEDS FOR COMMUNICATION, COOPERATION, AND KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION. OUR INSIGHT COMES FROM BEING EMBEDDED BOTH WITH DOMAIN SCIENTISTS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. THROUGH FOUR CASES, WE HIGHLIGHT THE SCIENTISTS' UNIQUE CHALLENGES, STRATEGIES DEVELOPED TO ADDRESS THEM, AND THE SYSTEM COMPONENTS DESIGNED TO BETTER SUPPORT MANY OF THESE TACTICS. SPECIFICALLY, WE ADDRESS THE DIFFICULTIES OF FINDING, STANDARDIZING, INTERPRETING, AND VALIDATING DATA.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS OF EACH ALTERNATIVE WERE COMPUTED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE PRESENT VALUES FOR A LIFE SPAN OF 50YEARS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ACCOUNTING FOR A DIFFERENT LIFE EXPECTANCY FOR EACH PAVEMENT REHABILITATION STRATEGY. THE PRESENT VALUES WERE THEN INCORPORATED INTO A CORRESPONDING EIO-LCA MODEL. THE RESULTS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED CONCRETE PAVEMENT (CRCP) IS THE MOST SUSTAINABLE CHOICE AND MUCH PREFERABLE TO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR MINIMIZING NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS FROM THE LIFE-CYCLE PERSPECTIVE. THIS FINDING CHAMPIONS A WIDER ADOPTION OF CRCP FOR FUTURE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, AS CRCP'S RELATIVELY HIGH INITIAL CONSTRUCTION COST CAN BE RECOUPED BY LONG-TERM SUSTAINED BENEFITS. THE RESULTS AND FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CAN SERVE AS A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR INDUSTRY PRACTITIONERS AND DECISION-MAKERS TO MAKE BETTER-INFORMED PROJECT DECISIONS WHEN CHOOSING THE MOST SUSTAINABLE PAVEMENT ALTERNATIVES FROM A LIFE-CYCLE PERSPECTIVE.

FOR THE STUDY, REPRESENTATIVE DATA SETS CONCERNING GERMAN FOOD PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION WERE USED. THESE WERE COMPLEMENTED BY THE DANISH LCA FOOD DATABASE AND OTHER LCA DATA TO ANALYSE THE IMPACT OF FOOD IMPORTS. AS REGARDS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT, GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) WAS ASSESSED, WHICH INCLUDED EMISSIONS FROM DIRECT LAND USE CHANGE AND LAND USE (DLUC, LU), ALONG WITH THREE INVENTORY INDICATORS (AMMONIA EMISSIONS, LAND USE, BLUE WATER USE). THE FOLLOWING FOOD GROUPS WERE ANALYSED FROM CRADLE-TO-STORE AND THEIR IMPACTS WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER: ANIMAL-BASED FOODS (MEAT PRODUCTS, MILK PRODUCTS, EGG PRODUCTS AND FISH PRODUCTS), PLANT-BASED FOODS (GRAIN PRODUCTS, VEGETABLES, FRUITS, POTATO PRODUCTS, MARGARINE/OILS, SUGAR/SWEETS). THE REFERENCE YEAR IN THE STUDY IS THE YEAR 2006. FOR ALL INDICATORS, THE RESULTS SHOW STRONG VARIATION BETWEEN THE GENDERS. EVEN IF THE PHYSIOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT CONSUMPTION PATTERNS AMONG MEN AND WOMEN ARE ADJUSTED ON A WEIGHT BASIS, MEN SHOW A HIGHER IMPACT IN TERMS OF GWP (CO2 EQ. +25\%), AMMONIA EMISSIONS (+30\%) AND LAND USE (+24\%). IN CONTRAST, WOMEN DEMONSTRATE A HIGHER WATER DEMAND (+11\%). THESE DIFFERENCES ARE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY A HIGHER SHARE OF MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS IN THE USUAL DIET OF MEN (+28\%) AS WELL AS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLES IN THE DIET OF WOMEN (+40\%). IF MEN WERE TO SHIFT QUALITATIVELY TO THE USUAL DIET OF WOMEN, THEN 14.8 MT CO2 EQ. AND 60.1 KT AMMONIA EMISSIONS COULD BE SAVED ANNUALLY.

PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT, A MAIN COMPONENT OF THE EF, REPRESENTS THE LANDS USED BY PRODUCTION SECTORS FOR PRODUCING THE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR THE FINAL CONSUMPTION OF A GIVEN HUMAN POPULATION. THERE HAVE BEEN, AT LEAST, TWO ALTERNATIVES IN ESTIMATING THE PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT. ONE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATES OF `APPARENT CONSUMPTION' OF EACH TYPE OF RESOURCE, ALONG THE LINE OF THE METHODOLOGY PROPOSED BY WACKERNAGEL AND PEES (WACKERNAGEL, M., PEES, W.E., 1996) AND ITS LATER REFINEMENT. THE OTHER, SUGGESTED BY BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) IS BASED ON THE MONETARY VALUES OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, THE INFORMATION RECORDED IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE FORMER FACES THE CHALLENGE OF DISTINGUISHING THE COMMODITIES USED AS INTERMEDIATE INPUT FROM THOSE AS FINAL CONSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH ITS RECENT DEVELOPMENT HAS TRIED TO CALCULATE THE RAW MATERIALS USED DIRECTLY IN TRADED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS (WACKERNAGEL, M., LEWAN, L., HANSSON, C.B., 1999A) IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB BECAUSE THE INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED. USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO CONSIDER THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS OF SUPPORTING FINAL DEMAND, MAY ALLEVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY. BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) ADOPTED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE FOOTPRINT OF NEW ZEALAND. IN THEIR CALCULATION, THEY USED LAND MULTIPLIERS TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCTION LAND AREAS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE OUTPUTS FOR DOMESTIC FINAL CONSUMPTION DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AND PRESENTED THE ESTIMATES UNDER THREE LAND CATEGORIES, AGRICULTURAL LAND, FOREST LAND, AND DEGRADED LAND. HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION CAUSES ERRORS IN THE CONCEPT AND CALCULATION.

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF URBAN SYSTEMS HAVE FOCUSED ON THE CITY OR METROPOLITAN AREAS UNDER STUDY. THERE IS A NEED TO INCORPORATE URBAN LAND TELECONNECTIONS TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A CITY AND DISTANT LAND AREAS DURING THE PROCESS OF URBANIZATION. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE TELECONNECTION OF THE ENERGY AND MATERIAL FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH TAIPEI'S PERI-URBANIZATION AND REMOTE AREAS IN TAIWAN. THE CROSS-SCALE EMERGY SYNTHESIS OF TAIPEI AND TAIWAN WAS EXAMINED FIRST TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE MATERIAL AND ENERGY FLOWS BETWEEN TAIPEI AND TAIWAN. THE EXPLOITATION OF NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES IN TAIWAN DURING THE 1990S WAS DRIVEN MAINLY BY THE CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TAKING PLACE IN TAIPEI. FURTHERMORE, COMPARED WITH TAIWAN, THE TAIPEI AREA RELIES HEAVILY ON EXTERNAL RESOURCES. THE RESULTS OF THE EMERGY EVALUATION OF MATERIALS FLOWS IN TAIPEI INDICATED THAT 85\% OF THE CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS USED WERE IMPORTED FROM OTHER REMOTE AREAS DURING THE PAST 30 YEARS. THE USE OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS IN TAIPEI HAD A HIGHER INTENSITY IN THE CITY CENTER DURING 1982-1992 AND IN THE PERI-URBAN AREA DURING 2002-2014. THE RESULTS OF THE EMERGY SYNTHESIS INDICATED THAT URBAN LAND TELECONNECTIONS EXIST BETWEEN PERI-URBAN AREAS OF TAIPEI AND OTHER DISTANT AREAS IN TAIWAN.",""

AS IN OBSERVATIONS, VARIATIONS IN THE POLARITY AND AMPLITUDE OF THIS STRUCTURE FUNCTION ARE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF SPATIALLY AVERAGED SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY. RESULTS FROM PARALLEL INTEGRATIONS OF MODELS WITH MORE SIMPLIFIED TREATMENTS OF THE OCEAN CONFIRM THAT THE CONTRAST IN THERMAL INERTIA BETWEEN LAND AND OCEAN IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE COWL PATTERN, WHEREAS DYNAMICAL AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS DO NOT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE.

REALIZING THIS AIM REQUIRES AN INDICATOR SYSTEM WITH A CONSUMPTION-BASED (OR ``FOOTPRINT'') PERSPECTIVE THAT CAPTURES BOTH LOCAL AND GLOBAL IMPACTS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME. IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A SET OF NOVEL FOOTPRINT INDICATORS TO MEASURE ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES FROM SWEDISH FOOD CONSUMPTION. THE INDICATORS ARE CALCULATED BY COMBINING DATA AND STATISTICS ON AGROCHEMICALS AND DEFORESTATION EMISSIONS WITH EXIOBASE3, A GLOBAL MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT (MR10) DATABASE WITH A UNIQUE AND HIGH LEVEL OF PRODUCT DETAIL ACROSS COUNTRIES. WE ESTIMATE THE USE OF PESTICIDES AND ANTIMICROBIAL VETERINARY MEDICINES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT SWEDISH FOOD CONSUMPTION AND COMPARE THOSE FOOTPRINT INDICATORS WITH THE EU-28. CARBON EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION ARE CALCULATED WITH A LAND BALANCE MODEL AND INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF FOOD. WE FIND THAT SWEDEN, WITH ITS LARGE RELIANCE OF FOOD IMPORTS, EXERT A SIGNIFICANT AGRO-CHEMICAL AND CLIMATE FOOTPRINT OVERSEAS, MAINLY IN THE EU AND LATIN AMERICA. WE POINT TO A NEED FOR BETTER DATA AND STATISTICS ON THE USE OF PESTICIDES, VETERINARY MEDICINES AND AGROCHEMICALS RESIDUALS (ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES) AS WELL AS IMPROVED SPATIAL DATA ON AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY TO FURTHER REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF SWEDISH FOOD CONSUMPTION.

THESE MODELS RELY ON ELASTIC PRICES ALGORITHMS TO ESTIMATE TRADE FLOWS. ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE, TWO DIFFERENT RUBMRIO ELASTIC PRICES ALGORITHMS EXIST: AN ORIGINAL ALGORITHM THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEORETICAL INVESTIGATION, AND A MODIFIED ALGORITHM THAT HAS BEEN COMMONLY USED IN PRACTICE. THE ORIGINAL ALGORITHM MEASURES PRICES AND ACQUISITION COSTS IN DOLLARS, WHEREAS THE MODIFIED ALGORITHM MEASURES PRICES AND ACQUISITION COSTS IN UNITS OF UTILITY. BY DERIVING THE EQUIVALENCE CONDITIONS OF THESE ALGORITHMS, IT IS PROVEN THAT THE MODIFIED ALGORITHM IS ONLY EQUIVALENT TO THE ORIGINAL ALGORITHM UNDER VERY RESTRICTIVE CONDITIONS: FIRST, INITIAL SECTOR PRICES MUST BE THE SAME IN EACH REGION; SECOND, COST PARAMETERS MUST BE THE SAME FOR ALL INDUSTRIES; AND THIRD, NO OTHER VARIABLES CAN BE INTRODUCED INTO THE ORIGINAL TRADE COEFFICIENT MODEL SPECIFICATION. IN A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE, THE MODIFIED ALGORITHM RESULTS IN A MEAN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGE ERROR OF 56\% FOR TRADE FLOW VALUES. DUE TO THESE RESTRICTIONS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE STUDIES ADOPT THE APPROACH OF DETERMINING INITIAL RUBMRIO PRICES ENDOGENOUSLY BEFORE CALIBRATION, WHICH ARE SHOWN BE SOLVED DIRECTLY FROM A SYSTEM OF LINEAR EQUATIONS, AND APPLYING THE ORIGINAL RUBMRIO ELASTIC PRICES ALGORITHM (MEASURING PRICES IN DOLLARS).",""

GLOBALIZATION INCREASES WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC LINKS. THE DISPLACEMENT OF PASTURE LANDS FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER OCCURS WHEN GOODS ARE TRADED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND REGIONS, THEREBY SHIFTING PRESSURES ON LOCAL PASTURE LAND RESOURCES. THIS PAPER APPLIES A SYSTEMS INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL TO EXAMINE HOW PASTURE LANDS IN CHINA ARE USED TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE OVER THE PERIOD OF 2000-2015. AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PROCESSING WERE THE TWO MAJOR SECTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE LARGEST VOLUME OF EMBODIED PASTURE LAND FOR FULFILLING HOUSEHOLD DEMANDS IN 2015. ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL CONSUMPTION-BASED PASTURE LAND USE IN CHINA IS FLUCTUATING, EMBODIED PASTURE LAND INTENSITIES EXHIBITED A DECREASING TREND IN 2000-2015, THEREBY SHOWING THE EFFORT OF CHINA TO IMPROVE PASTURE LAND USE EFFICIENCY. REGARDING TRADE PATTERNS, THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR IS THE LARGEST NET IMPORTER OF PASTURE LANDS IN CHINA, WHILE THE GARMENT SECTOR IS THE LARGEST NET EXPORTER. WE ALSO FIND THAT CHINA IS A NET EXPORTER OF EMBODIED PASTURE LANDS THROUGH THE STUDY PERIOD. THIS SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF PASTURE LAND USE IN CHINA IS CRITICAL IN CUSTOMIZING AND PRIORITIZING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE PASTURE LAND MANAGEMENT IN CHINA.",""

WE PRESENT AN INNOVATIVE GLOBALLY CONSISTENT HYBRID LAND-FLOW ACCOUNTING METHOD TO TRACK BIOMASS FLOWS AND EMBODIED LAND ALONG GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. IT USES THE LARGE FAOSTAT DATABASE, WHICH IS, FOR NON-FOOD COMMODITIES, COMPLEMENTED WITH A MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. WE EMPLOY THE HYBRID MODEL GLOBALLY BETWEEN 1995 AND 2010 AND PRESENT RESULTS FOR 21 REGIONAL MARKETS. RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE GROWING INTEGRATION IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IN 2010, 31\% OF CROPLAND CULTIVATION WAS FOR EXPORT MARKETS COMPARED TO 16\% IN 1995. THE HIGHER LAND DEMAND OF LIVESTOCK-BASED DIETS, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR ONE THIRD OF GLOBAL CROPLAND USE, AND DIFFERENCES IN LAND USE INTENSITIES CAUSE LARGE REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN EXTENTS AND COMPOSITION OF LAND FOOTPRINTS. THE UTILIZATION OF CROPLAND CHANGED TOWARDS A GROWING IMPORTANCE OF THE NON-FOOD SECTOR ACCOUNTING FOR 12\% IN 2010. COMPARING LAND QUALITY WEIGHTED CROPLAND FOOTPRINTS ACROSS REGIONS FURTHER REVEALS LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE APPROPRIATION OF AVAILABLE GLOBAL CROPLAND PRODUCTIVITY. BECAUSE OF LARGE UNCERTAINTIES AND QUALITY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACTUAL USE OF GRASSLAND FOR FEEDING RUMINANTS, WE PROPOSE LAND QUALITY WEIGHTED GRASSLAND FOOTPRINTS TO DISCUSS THE ADDITIONAL LAND USE FOR RUMINANT LIVESTOCK PRODUCTS.",""

THIS STUDY ESTABLISHED A NETWORK-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR THE WATER-LAND NEXUS IN FOOD TRADE TO INVESTIGATE THE SPATIAL LINKAGES OF WATER, LAND, AND FOOD. BASED ON THE GRAVITY MODEL AND LINEAR PROGRAMMING OPTIMIZATION, THE FOOD TRADE MODEL WAS FIRST BUILT TO SIMULATE CROP TRADE. THEN WATER CONSUMPTION AND LAND USE FOR VARIOUS CROPS IN DIFFERENT REGIONS WERE INVENTORIED TO ESTABLISH THE FOOD-RELATED VIRTUAL WATER NETWORK AND FOOD-RELATED VIRTUAL LAND NETWORK. GREY WATER RELATED TO WATER QUALITY, BLUE AND GREEN WATER RELATED TO WATER QUANTITY, WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE FOOD-RELATED VIRTUAL WATER ACCOUNTING FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY THE ROLE OF FOOD TRADE IN THE SPATIAL REALLOCATION OF WATER. SIMILARLY, THE FOOD-RELATED VIRTUAL LAND NETWORK WAS BUILT BASED ON THE LAND USE FOR DIFFERENT CROPS AND THE FOOD TRADE MODEL. FINALLY, A CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO ANALYZE THE PROPERTIES AND CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE FOOD-RELATED VIRTUAL WATER/LAND NETWORKS OF CHINA. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE GREEN AND GREY WATER CONSUMPTION ASSOCIATED WITH FOOD PRODUCTION, THE EFFECTS OF WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN NEGLECTED, ACCOUNT FOR A HUGE PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION, ESPECIALLY IN WATER-SCARCE PROVINCES. THE CONTROLLERS/DEPENDENTS IN THE NETWORKS THAT HAVE STRONG CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PROVINCES WERE IDENTIFIED. THE PROPOSED NETWORK-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR THE WATER-LAND NEXUS MAY HELP BOOST SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH SPATIAL REALLOCATION OF WATER AND LAND VIA FOOD TRADE AND EXPLORE PATHWAYS FOR SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER, LAND, AND FOOD RESOURCES.",""
