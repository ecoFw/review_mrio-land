HOWEVER, THE LITERATURE THAT DISCUSSES DIFFERENT STRUCTURES OF ENVIRONMENTAL EXTENSIONS (EES), THAT IS, THE SCOPE OF PHYSICAL FLOWS AND THEIR ATTRIBUTION TO SECTORS IN THE MONETARY INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE (MIOT), REMAINS FRAGMENTED. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS OF APPLYING TWO DIFFERENT BUT FREQUENTLY USED DESIGNS OF EES, USING THE CASE OF ENERGY ACCOUNTING, WHERE ONE REPRESENTS ENERGY SUPPLY WHILE THE OTHER ENERGY USE IN THE ECONOMY. WE DERIVE BOTH EXTENSIONS FROM AN OFFICIAL ENERGY SUPPLY-USE DATASET AND APPLY THEM TO THE SAME SINGLE-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT (SRIO) MODEL OF AUSTRIA, THEREBY ISOLATING THE EFFECT THAT STEMS FROM THE DECISION FOR THE EXTENSION DESIGN. WE ALSO CROSSCHECK THE SRIO RESULTS WITH ENERGY FOOTPRINTS FROM THE GLOBAL MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (GMRIO) DATASET EXIOBASE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RANKING OF FOOTPRINTS OF FINAL DEMAND CATEGORIES (E.G., HOUSEHOLD AND EXPORT) IS SENSITIVE TO THE EXTENSION DESIGN AND THAT PRODUCT-LEVEL RESULTS CAN VARY BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE. THE GMRIO-BASED COMPARISON FURTHER REVEALS THAT FOR A FEW COUNTRIES THE SUPPLY-EXTENSION RESULT CAN BE TWICE THE SIZE OF THE USE-EXTENSION FOOTPRINT (E.G., AUSTRALIA AND NORWAY). WE PROPOSE A GRAPH APPROACH TO PROVIDE A GENERALIZED FRAMEWORK TO DISCLOSING THE DESIGN OF EES. WE DISCUSS THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO EXTENSION DESIGNS BY APPLYING ANALOGIES TO HYBRID LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND CONCLUDE THAT OUR FINDINGS ARE RELEVANT FOR MONITORING OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS AND CORPORATE FOOTPRINT ACCOUNTING.",""

GIVEN THEIR IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF AIR QUALITY AND SUSTAINABLE AND SAFER MOVEMENT OF GOODS, HEAVY-DUTY TRUCKS (HDTS), CARRYING THE MAJORITY OF U.S. FREIGHT, ARE CONSIDERED AN IDEAL DOMAIN FOR THE APPLICATION OF CAV TECHNOLOGY. AN INPUT-OUTPUT (IO) MODEL IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE EORA DATABASE-A DETAILED IO DATABASE THAT CONSISTS OF NATIONAL IO TABLES, COVERING ALMOST THE ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY. USING THE EORA-BASED IO MODEL, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES AND ASSESSES THE ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF AUTOMATED DIESEL AND BATTERY ELECTRIC HDTS BASED ON 20 MACRO-LEVEL INDICATORS. THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCES OF THESE HDTS ARE THEN COMPARED TO THAT OF A CONVENTIONAL DIESEL HDT. THE STUDY FINDS AN AUTOMATED DIESEL HDT TO CAUSE 18\% MORE FATALITIES THAN AN AUTOMATED ELECTRIC HDT. THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) OF AUTOMATED DIESEL HDTS IS ESTIMATED TO BE 4.7 THOUSAND METRIC TONS CO2-EQ. HIGHER THAN THAT OF AUTOMATED ELECTRIC HDTS. THE HEALTH IMPACT COSTS RESULTING FROM AN AUTOMATED DIESEL HDT ARE TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF AN AUTOMATED ELECTRIC HDT. OVERALL, THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT AUTOMATION BRINGS IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SELECTED SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS OF HDTS SUCH AS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, LIFE CYCLE COST, GDP, DECREASE IN IMPORT, AND INCREASE IN INCOME. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TRADE-OFFS PARTICULARLY BETWEEN MINERAL AND FOSSIL RESOURCE LOSSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO COMPLICATE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES REGARDING THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY.",""

REGIONAL AIR QUALITY VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO INTENSIVE INTERPROVINCIAL TRADES, DIVERSIFIED RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS AND COMPLICATED ECONOMIC STRUCTURES. THIS STUDY BREAKS THE LIMITATIONS OF MEASURING ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY ONLY FROM A SINGLE PERSPECTIVE AND ESTABLISHES A THREE-PERSPECTIVE ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANT EQUIVALENTS ACCOUNTING MODEL (OR APE ACCOUNTING MODEL) FOR AIR-POLLUTION INEQUALITY ASSESSMENT UNDER ENVIRONMENTALLY-EXTEND MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK. FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES OF LOCAL PRODUCTION (I.E. PRODUCTION-BASED), FINAL DEMAND (I.E. CONSUMPTION-BASED) AND PRIMARY SUPPLY (I.E. INCOME-BASED), APE EMISSIONS, APE TRANSFERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL GINI COEFFICIENT ARE INVESTIGATED TO EXAM EMISSION RESPONSIBILITIES OF VARIOUS IMPACT FACTORS, EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF INTER-PROVINCIAL TRADES ON POLLUTANTS TRANSFERS, AND CHARACTERIZE REGIONAL EMISSION INEQUALITIES AT BOTH PROVINCIAL AND SECTORAL LEVELS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LOCAL EMITTERS ARE MERELY PARTS OF CONTRIBUTORS TO AIR POLLUTION.

ACCELERATING GLOBALIZATION FURTHER EXACERBATE REGIONAL INEQUITIES HIDDEN BEHIND THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. THEREFORE, THE ENERGY USE OF CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY EMBODIED IN INTERREGIONAL TRADE NEEDS TO BE REVEALED CONSIDERING THE REGIONAL DISPARITIES. CHINA, AS THE LARGEST DEVELOPING COUNTRY, SUFFERS FROM MASSIVE SPENDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, INVESTIGATING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CHINA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS IMPERATIVE. PREVIOUS RESEARCHES FAIL TO PROVIDE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF ENERGY INTERACTIONS INDUCED BY THE GLOBAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THIS STUDY DETAILS THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BY MERGING 31 CHINESE REGIONS INTO THE COMPLEX GLOBAL TRADING NETWORK, WHICH IS BENEFICIAL FOR MAKING FAIR ENERGY REDUCTION STRATEGIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH EMBODIED ENERGY USE AND DIRECT ENERGY USE EXHIBIT A STRONG POSITIVE LINEAR CORRELATION WITH GDP. INTERREGIONAL TRADE INCREASES THE INEQUALITY OF ENERGY USE IN THE GLOBAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY, IN WHICH 81.67\% OF THE REGIONS POSSESS AN ENERGY INEQUALITY INDICATOR OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY OVER 0.80, THUS PROVING THAT THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY CONSUMES A LARGE AMOUNT OF NONLOCAL ENERGY. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EMBODIED INTENSITY AND GDP, WHEREAS A WEAK LINEAR CORRELATION EXISTS BETWEEN INTENSITY AND EMBODIED ENERGY USE. IN CHINA, SHANXI, XINJIANG, AND INNER MONGOLIA REPRESENT A HIGH INTENSITY. THERE IS A WEAK POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN URBANIZATION RATE AND EMBODIED ENERGY VALUES.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ON THE SUPPLY-SIDE, THE CHINA'S MAJORIZATION IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE WOULD RESULT IN A DECLINE OF PROPORTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM HIGH-CARBON ENERGY (RAW COAL, DIESEL OIL, COMBUSTION OIL, ETC.) AND A RISE IN PROPORTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM LOW-CARBON ENERGY (NATURAL GAS, OTHER GAS, ETC.) IN ENERGY SYSTEMS. MOREOVER, THE STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION OF LOW-CARBON ENERGY WAS GENERALLY MORE ROBUST THAN THAT OF HIGH-CARBON ENERGY, AND 2012-2015 WAS THE OPTIMAL PERIOD FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE IN THE STUDY INTERVAL. ON THE DEMAND-SIDE, INTERMEDIATE USE (ENTERPRISES) WAS STILL THE DRIVING FACTOR FOR ENERGY CARBON EMISSIONS, ALTHOUGH END-USERS (RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT) HAD A LIMITED DRIVING EFFECT ON ENERGY CARBON EMISSIONS. SPECIFICALLY, FOR INDUSTRIES WITH INTERMEDIATE USE OF ENERGY, THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LIGHT INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, CONSTRUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, AND THE POWER SECTOR TO CARBON EMISSIONS EXHIBITED A DOWNWARD, FLUCTUATING TREND; THE USE OF ENERGY BY HEAVY INDUSTRY BARELY CHANGED, AND THE USE OF ENERGY BY THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AND FOSSIL ENERGY SECTOR SHOWED A RISING, FLUCTUATING TREND.

RESULTS, HOWEVER, VARY GREATLY ACROSS APPLICATIONS, IMPACT CATEGORIES AND INDUSTRY/PRODUCT TYPES, AND SO SPECIFIC IMPLICATIONS WILL DEPEND ON THE RESEARCH QUESTION AND SCOPE OF ANALYSIS. OVERALL, ENDOGENISING CAPITAL HAS A LARGER IMPACT THAN INCLUDING MISSING SERVICES. CONCLUSIONS THIS EXERCISE HIGHLIGHTS TWO FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS FOR FOOTPRINT MODELLING: THE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND THE FACILITATION OF MODEL INTEGRATION. FIRST, THE PROPOSED METHOD INCREASES SYSTEM COMPLETENESS OF LCA (EXTERNAL CONSISTENCY WITH THE SUBJECT OF STUDY, NAMELY ECONOMIC SYSTEMS) AT THE EXPENSE OF INTERNAL INCONSISTENCIES STEMMING FROM ONTOLOGICAL DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN INPUT-OUTPUT AND LCI SYSTEMS (E.G. SYSTEM COMPLETENESS). THIS DISCREPANCY CAN BE MITIGATED BY EXPLOITING THE POTENTIAL OF INTEGRATED HYBRID LCA TO CREATE A HIGHLY INTERCONNECTED HYBRID SYSTEM. SECOND, THIS APPROACH SHOWS HOW FOOTPRINT MODELS CAN COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER TOWARDS MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSISTENT DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC METABOLISM.",""

MEANWHILE, THE MANUFACTURING OF EXPORT PRODUCTS HAS ALSO RESULTED IN A LARGE AMOUNT OF SO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA. TO EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EXPORT OF CHINA'S FINAL USE PRODUCTS (ECFUP) AND SO2 EMISSIONS, THIS PAPER FIRST USED THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) MODEL TO STUDY THE SO2 EMISSIONS CAUSED BY ECFUP DURING 2003-2011. THEN, THIS PAPER USES STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS (SDA) TO DECOMPOSE THE FACTORS AFFECTING SO2 EMISSION INTO TECHNICAL EFFECT, STRUCTURAL EFFECT AND SCALE EFFECT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT (1) THE AMOUNTS OF CHINA'S SO2 EMISSIONS CAUSED BY THE ECFUP HAVE INCREASED (2003-2007), DECLINED (2007-2009), AND INCREASED AGAIN (2009-2011). (2) SCALE EFFECT IS THE MAIN FACTOR THAT CAUSES THE INCREASE OF SO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA; TECHNICAL EFFECT MAINLY RESULTED IN A DECREASE OF EMISSIONS, WHEREAS STRUCTURAL EFFECT HAS LESS IMPACT. SPECIFICALLY, FROM 2003 TO 2011, SCALE EFFECT INCREASED DOMESTIC SO2 EMISSIONS BY 2.2 MILLION TONS; TECHNICAL EFFECT AND STRUCTURAL EFFECT REDUCED BY 2.4 MILLION TONS AND 0.5 MILLION TONS OF EMISSIONS, RESPECTIVELY. (3) FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS, THERE IS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CONSUMPTION OF THE ECFUP AND CHINA'S SO2 EMISSIONS. AMONG THEM, NAFTA (ACCOUNTING FOR 33.77\%) LEADS TO THE LARGEST SO2 EMISSIONS, AND OTHER EU (5.79\%) IS THE LEAST.

THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THE CHINESE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM AND IDENTIFY EMISSION HOTSPOTS. METHODS ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL PATH ANALYSIS WERE USED TO ASSESS THE LIFECYCLE GHG EMISSIONS OF THE CHINESE HEALTH-CARE SYSTEM. A SATELLITE ACCOUNT OF GHG EMISSIONS WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR 46 ECONOMIC SECTORS IN CHINA USING ENERGY DATA FROM THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF STATISTICS BASED ON THE NUMBERS REPORTED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF ENTERPRISES.

WHILE IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY ARE COMMONLY THE EXPECTED GENERAL SOLUTION, LIFESTYLE CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS ON CONSUMPTION ARE ALSO NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE POLLUTION. SUCH REGULATIONS MAY MODIFY PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, THUS ALTERING ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STABILITY. THEREFORE, ANALYSES NEED TO CONSIDER NUMEROUS DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE SECTORS IN THE ECONOMY IN WHICH EMISSION REDUCTION CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE LEAST SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT. THROUGH AN EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER GIVES AN INSIGHT INTO THE INTRICATE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECTORS OF AN ECONOMIC REGION AND THEIR RESPECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS. TAKING BOTH A PRODUCER AND A CONSUMER-BASED PERSPECTIVE, SECTORS ARE ANALYSED AND CATEGORISED THROUGH VARIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS. THE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH DISCERNS BETWEEN EMISSION INVENTORIES OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES AND EMBODIED EMISSIONS OF CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, THUS ASSIGNING A DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES. FURTHER, AN INNOVATIVE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMISATION MODEL IS DEVELOPED WITH CONSIDERATION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP), GHG EMISSIONS, AND EMPLOYMENT. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES MAPPING AN OPTIMISED SPACE OF SCENARIOS FOR EMISSION REDUCTION THROUGH CONSUMPTION LIMITATION WITH A MINIMAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC LOSS. THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY WAS USED AS A CASE STUDY. RESULTS SHOW A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE ALLOCATION OF EMISSIONS FROM A PRODUCER AND A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE, INDICATING THAT MANY SECTORS RELY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF EMISSIONS-INTENSIVE SECTORS FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THE OPTIMISATION, ALL POSSIBLE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE LINKED TO CONSUMPTION LIMIT SCENARIOS OF MINIMISED ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT LOSSES. THE MODEL IS EFFECTIVE IN SHOWING AREAS OF INTEREST FOR FURTHER SCRUTINY IN CONSUMPTION MODIFICATION TO MEET A NATIONAL AGENDA.

AT PRESENT, EMPIRICAL STUDIES ASSESSING SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS OF AVIATION BIOFUEL ARE RARE IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, IS TO ASSESS KEY EFFECTS OF AVIATION BIOFUEL PRODUCTION ON EMPLOYMENT, GDP, AND TRADE BALANCE. A SCENARIOS-BASED INPUT-OUTPUT (IO) ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE THESE SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS, TAKING BRAZILIAN AVIATION BIOFUEL PRODUCTION TO 2050 AS AN EXAMPLE. TO ADDRESS THE UNCERTAINTY OF IO ANALYSIS, WE HAVE PROPOSED A STOCHASTIC SIMULATION APPROACH FOR THE TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS IN THE IO MODEL. FOUR DISTINCT SCENARIOS WERE DEVELOPED. IN EACH, THREE POTENTIAL COMBINATIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES AND FEEDSTOCKS FOR PRODUCING AVIATION BIOFUEL WERE EVALUATED: SUGARCANE VIA ALCOHOL TO JET (ATJ), MACAUBA VIA HYDRO-PROCESSED ESTERS AND FATTY ACIDS (HEFA), AND EUCALYPTUS VIA FISCHER-TROPSCH (FT). AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE FOUND THAT THE PRODUCTION OF AVIATION BIOFUEL WOULD CREATE AROUND 12,000-65,000 JOBS, WHILE CONTRIBUTING US\$200-1100 MILLION TO BRAZIL'S GDP UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT SUPPLY CHAINS. THE SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS CALCULATED DETERMINISTICALLY WERE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN THE STOCHASTIC OUTCOMES, WHICH CAN BE EXPLAINED BY FACTORS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL LEARNING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. AVIATION BIOFUEL PRODUCTION SHOWED LARGE POSITIVE NET SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND GDP, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE FOSSIL SECTORS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS ARE: FIRST, THE POLICY OF ELECTRICITY SUBSTITUTION ALONE IS NOT ADEQUATE TO REDUCE THE DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION UNDER CHINA'S CURRENT POWER GENERATION STRUCTURE, WE SHOULD ALSO INCREASE THE USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. SECOND, THE POWER SECTOR PLAYS A LEADING ROLE IN STIMULATING ECONOMIC OUTPUT, AND THE INCREASING ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION DUE TO THE POLICY OF ELECTRICITY SUBSTITUTION CAN BOOST THE GREEN DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S ECONOMY.",""

THE EEMRIO LINKS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES FROM THE GLOBAL TRADE ANALYSIS PROJECT (GTAP) DATABASE WITH LAND USE AND FOUR INDICATORS OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS. WE INCLUDED THREE ALPHA DIVERSITY INDICATORS (LOSS OF MEAN SPECIES ABUNDANCE, RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AND RELATIVE SPECIES RICHNESS) AND ONE INDICATOR OF GAMMA DIVERSITY (VULNERABILITY-WEIGHTED RELATIVE SPECIES RICHNESS LOSS). WHILE THE THREE ALPHA DIVERSITY INDICATORS REFLECT LOCAL DIVERSITY WITHIN A SITE, THE GAMMA DIVERSITY INDICATOR CAPTURES GLOBAL DIVERSITY BY WEIGHTING REGIONAL SPECIES RICHNESS WITH SPECIES' EXTINCTION VULNERABILITY IN A REGION. WE FOUND THAT THE THREE ALPHA DIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS SHOW CLOSE ALIGNMENT (R(S) > 0.93), WHILE THERE WAS LIMITED CONVERGENCE BETWEEN ALPHA AND GAMMA DIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS (R(S) < 0.22). THE ALPHA DIVERSITY INDICATORS IDENTIFIED A DIVERSE SET OF REGIONS WITH HIGH PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION-BASED BIODIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS ACROSS THE GLOBE, WHILE THE GAMMA DIVERSITY INDICATOR EMPHASIZED HUMAN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS THREATENING PARTICULARLY TROPICAL BIODIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH ALL FOOTPRINTS ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO RISING HOUSEHOLD EXPENDITURE, THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS WEAKER AND HIGHLY UNCERTAIN FOR THE GAMMA DIVERSITY FOOTPRINTS.

THE FOCUS WAS ON ECOTOXIC AND HUMAN TOXIC IMPACTS. THE AIM WAS TO TEST MODEL OUTPUT AGAINST EXPERT JUDGMENT ON CHEMICAL RISK ASSESSMENT. AN EMISSION INVENTORY WAS COLLECTED FOR FINLAND DESCRIBING THE YEAR 2005. THE INVENTORY INCLUDED PUBLICLY REPORTED EMISSIONS TO AIR AND WATER AND IT WAS COMPLEMENTED BY THE EMISSIONS OF TRIBUTYLTIN, BENZENE, AND PESTICIDES FROM RESEARCH PAPERS AND STATISTICS. THE EMISSIONS WERE CHARACTERIZED WITH THREE LCIA MODELS: IMPACT 2002+, RECIPE, AND USETOX AND PRIORITY SUBSTANCES WERE IDENTIFIED. THE RESULTS WERE CONNECTED TO AN ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL TO STUDY PRIORITY PRODUCTS AND SUPPLY CHAINS. A COMPARISON WAS MADE WITH TWO INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS OF THE CHEMICAL STATUS AND HUMAN EXPOSURE IN THE BALTIC REGION. THE THREE ASSESSED MODELS PRESENTED VERY DIFFERENT PRIORITIES.

SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM COMMONLY REFER TO THE IDEA OF ``SMART GROWTH'' BASED ON INCREASING EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF NATURE FOR ECONOMIC PRODUCTION (ECO-EFFICIENCY). IN THIS PAPER, WE SHOW HOW ECO-EFFICIENCY CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE TOURISM STRATEGIES ON LOCAL SCALE BASED ON AN AUGMENTED REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL THAT DELIVERS INFORMATION ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, LAND USE (AS INDICATOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE), AND EMPLOYMENT. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS APPROACH VIA A CASE STUDY OF THE TOURIST DESTINATION OF DAVOS IN THE SWISS ALPS. THE MODEL PREDICTS THAT THE KEY DRIVERS OF LAND-USE EFFICIENCY ARE: (I) THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF TOURISTS, (II) OCCUPANCY INTENSITY, AND (III) THE DENSITY OF BEDS PER AREA COVERED BY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND HOTELS. THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF INCREASING BED CAPACITY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE TOURIST CATEGORY TRIGGERING THE DEVELOPMENT; THIS CAN ALSO BE USED TO ATTRACT NEW TOURIST CATEGORIES AT THE EXPENSE OF TOURIST CATEGORIES THAT MAKE INEFFICIENT USE OF AVAILABLE LAND.

WHILE WATER FOOTPRINTS ARE SOMETIMES UNDERSTOOD AS A MEASURE THAT INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT, THE WATER FOOTPRINT AS USED IN THIS PAPER REFERS TO VOLUMES OF WATER CONSUMED, WITHOUT INCLUDING WEIGHTING PROCEDURES TO ALLOW FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF IMPACTS. TWO TYPES OF APPROACHES HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO CALCULATE THE WATER FOOTPRINT IN THE LITERATURE: BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN APPROACHES. THIS STUDY COMPARES AND DISCUSSES ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE WATER FOOTPRINT OF NATIONS BASED ON TWO INPUT-OUTPUT TOP-DOWN APPROACHES (WATER EMBODIED IN BILATERAL TRADE (WEBT) AND MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (MRIO)) AND OF THE EXISTING NATIONAL WATER FOOTPRINT ACCOUNTS FROM THE LITERATURE BASED ON THE BOTTOM-UP APPROACH. THE DIFFERENCES IN THE BOTTOM-UP AND WEBT APPROACHES ARE CAUSED BY INTER-SECTORAL CUT-OFF, BECAUSE BOTTOM-UP APPROACHES DO NOT CONSIDER THE ENTIRE INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY CHAINS, WHILE THE WEBT METHOD COVERS THE WATER FOOTPRINT BY TRACING THE WHOLE DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN OF EACH COUNTRY. THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WEBT AND MRIO APPROACHES ARE DUE TO AN INTER-REGIONAL CUT-OFF EFFECT, AS THE WEBT APPROACH ONLY TRACES DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAINS WHEREAS THE MRIO APPROACH TRACES ENTIRE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. WE FOUND THAT BOTH BOTTOM-UP AND TOP-DOWN APPROACHES ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF EXISTING DATASETS, AND DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY.

HERE, WE TESTED A HYPOTHESIZED CONSEQUENCE OF CONNECTIVITY IN ECOSYSTEMS: THE HOMOGENIZATION OF RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS IN FLOW NETWORKS. SPECIFICALLY, WE TESTED THE GENERALITY OF THE SYSTEMS ECOLOGY HYPOTHESIS OF RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION IN 50 EMPIRICALLY DERIVED TROPHIC ECOSYSTEM MODELS REPRESENTING 35 DISTINCT ECOSYSTEMS. WE APPLIED NETWORK ENVIRON ANALYSIS (NEA) TO CALCULATE RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION FOR THESE MODELS, WHERE HOMOGENIZATION IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION OF THE DIRECT FLOW INTENSITY MATRIX (CV(G)) TO THE COVARIANCE OF THE INTEGRAL FLOW INTENSITY MATRIX (CV(N)). A RATIO GREATER THAN UNITY INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF HOMOGENIZATION. WE ALSO TESTED THE HYPOTHESES THAT HOMOGENIZATION INCREASES WITH SYSTEM SIZE, CONNECTANCE, AND CYCLING. WE FURTHER EVALUATED THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR RESULTS IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, WE VERIFIED THE CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE INPUT- AND OUTPUT-ORIENTED HOMOGENIZATION VALUES TO ENSURE THAT OUR RESULTS WERE NOT BIASED BY OUR DECISION TO FOCUS ON THE OUTPUT ORIENTATION. SECOND, WE CONDUCTED A MONTE CARLO BASED UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR RESULTS TO +/- 5\% ERROR INTRODUCED INTO THE ORIGINAL FLOW MATRICES FOR EACH MODEL. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION OCCURS UNIVERSALLY IN THE 50 ECOSYSTEM MODELS TESTED, WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 1.04 TO 1.97 AND A MEDIAN OF 1.61. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NETWORK HOMOGENIZATION AND SYSTEM SIZE AND CONNECTANCE, AS THE RESULTS OF THE LINEAR REGRESSIONS ARE INSIGNIFICANT. FURTHER, THERE IS ONLY WEAK SUPPORT FOR THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOMOGENIZATION AND CYCLING. WE CONFIRM THAT OUR RESULTS ARE NOT BIASED BY USING THE OUTPUT-ORIENTED HOMOGENIZATION VALUES INSTEAD OF THE INPUT-ORIENTED VALUES BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR REGRESSION BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF HOMOGENIZATION (R(2) = 0.38, P < 0.001) AND THE VALUES ARE WELL CORRELATED (S = 8,054, RHO = 0.61, P < 0.001).

HERE, WE INVESTIGATE HOW 18 ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA) INDICATORS THAT CHARACTERIZE ECOSYSTEM GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, AND CONDITION ARE AFFECTED BY UNCERTAINTY IN AN ECOSYSTEM MODEL OF LAKE SIDNEY LANIER (USA). WE APPLIED ENA TO 122 PLAUSIBLE PARAMETERIZATIONS OF THE ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPED BY BORRETT AND OSIDELE (2007, ECOLOGICAL MODELLING 200, 371-387), AND THEN USED THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV) TO COMPARE SYSTEM INDICATOR VARIABILITY.

FIRST, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT NON-RATIO INDICATORS WHOSE CALCULATION INCLUDES THE TST WOULD BE AT LEAST AS VARIABLE AS TST IF NOT MORE VARIABLE. SECOND, WE POSTULATED THAT INDICATORS CALCULATED AS RATIOS, WITH TST IN THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR WOULD TEND TO BE LESS VARIABLE THAN TST BECAUSE ITS INFLUENCE WILL CANCEL. LAST, WE EXPECTED THE AVERAGE MUTUAL INFORMATION (AMI) TO BE LESS VARIABLE THAN TST BECAUSE IT IS A BOUNDED FUNCTION. OUR WORK SHOWS THAT THE 18 INDICATORS GROUPED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES. THE FIRST GROUP HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER CVS THAN THE CV FOR TST. IN THIS GROUP, MODEL UNCERTAINTY IS AMPLIFIED RENDERING THESE THREE INDICATORS LESS USEFUL. THE SECOND GROUP OF FOUR INDICATORS SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN VARIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO TST. FINALLY, THERE ARE TWO GROUPS WHOSE CV VALUES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT FOR TST.

OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT ABOUT 3357 MILLION TONS CO2 EMISSIONS WERE EMBODIED IN THE EXPORTS AND THE EMISSIONS AVOIDED BY IMPORTS (EAI) WERE 2333 MILLION TONS IN 2005. THE AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION TO EMBODIED EMISSION FACTORS BY ELECTRICITY GENERATION WAS OVER 35\%. AND THAT BY CEMENT PRODUCTION WAS ABOUT 20\%. IT IMPLIES THAT THE PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS OF CHINA ARE MORE THAN THE CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS, WHICH IS EVIDENCE THAT CARBON LEAKAGE OCCURS UNDER THE CURRENT CLIMATE POLICIES AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES.

HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF OTHER SERVICE ACTIVITIES, DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS RELATED TO FINAL DEMAND ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT, DUE TO THE STRONG PULL EFFECT OF SERVICE ACTIVITIES ON OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ECONOMY. IN THIS RESPECT, WHOLESALE AND RETAIL TRADE, HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS, REAL ESTATE, RENTING AND BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION SERVICES SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED.

WE FOUND THAT THE OUT-DEGREE OF THE PRODUCTION NETWORK, INDICATING THE EXTENT OF THE PRESSURE ON PRICES OF DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRIES IN RESPONSE TO HIGHER CRUDE OIL PRICES, DECREASED IN SEVERAL SECTORS BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000. THE RESULTS BY SECTOR SHOWED THAT THE DECREASE WAS GREATEST IN THE CHEMICAL PRODUCT- AND IRON AND STEEL MANUFACTURING SECTORS, WHICH BOTH INDIRECTLY USE CRUDE OIL. THE DECREASE IN OUT-DEGREE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN THE PRODUCTION OF OIL-RELATED PRODUCTS AND INCREASE IN ENERGY SAVINGS BY THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THESE SECTORS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE SECTORS HAVING A HIGH OUT-DEGREE ENGAGE IN INTERMEDIATE PRODUCT PRODUCTION. CONVERSELY, THE IN-DEGREE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXTENT OF BEING PRESSURED BY OTHER SECTORS WITH INCREASED CRUDE OIL PRICES, ALSO DECREASED DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000. FROM THE RESULT OF THE IN-DEGREE, THIS STUDY FOUND THAT DEMATERIALIZATION AND WEIGHT REDUCTION OF FINAL PRODUCTS SUCH AS ``CELLULAR PHONES'' AND ``PERSONAL COMPUTERS'' HAD A MARKED EFFECT ON DECREASING IN-DEGREE. MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR THE TOP-RANKED SECTORS WITH THE HIGH OUT-DEGREE AND IN-DEGREE, SUCH AS ``ALIPHATIC INTERMEDIATES'' ``CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS'' ``PLASTIC PRODUCTS'' ``HOT ROLLED STEEL'' ``YARN AND FABRIC DYEING AND FINISHING'' THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE PRESSURE DUE TO RISING CRUDE OIL PRICES CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVELY EASED BY IMPLEMENTING MEASURES TARGETED AT UPSTREAM PRODUCTS AND SECTORS, WHILE CURRENT POLICY MEASURES TO ALLEVIATE OIL-PRICE INDUCED INFLATION ARE MAINLY TARGETED AT DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE.",""

AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE KYOTO PROTOCOL, WHERE ALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE ASSIGNED TO THE PRODUCER AND NO CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO WHERE GOODS ARE FINALLY CONSUMED. RATHER THAN TAKING THE CONVENTIONAL PRODUCER OR CONSUMER RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH, A THIRD PERSPECTIVE IS POSSIBLE IN WHICH RESPONSIBILITY IS SHARED. WE USE INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO APPLY ALL THREE OF THESE RESPONSIBILITY PERSPECTIVES TO NEW ZEALAND'S DOMESTIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. OUR MAIN FINDINGS FROM THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH ARE THAT NEW ZEALAND PRODUCERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 44\% OF DOMESTIC EMISSIONS, NEW ZEALAND CONSUMERS TAKE 28\%, AND 27\% ARE EXPORTED. A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH APPEARS TO DISTRIBUTE THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITY BETWEEN PARTIES MORE FAIRLY, AND IS LIKELY TO BE MORE WIDELY ACCEPTABLE THAN PURE PRODUCER OR CONSUMER PERSPECTIVES.

SECOND, WE PROVIDE A CASE STUDY THAT ANALYZES THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF AN ATTACK ON A MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS STADIUM. THE ESTIMATED LOSS FROM THE STADIUM ATTACK RANGES FROM \$62 BILLION TO \$73 BILLION. THE LARGEST LOSS COMES FROM THE LOSS OF LIVES, FOLLOWED BY THE REDUCED DEMAND FOR SPORTS STADIUM VISITS.

RECENTLY, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF REGIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN ISSUE, WHEN APPLYING LCA TO REGION-BASED STUDIES, IS HOW BEST TO CONSIDER AND REFLECT THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, AS THEY NEED TO BE AS CLOSE TO REALITY AS POSSIBLE. SEVERAL LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) ANALYSIS AND LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA) STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO STUDY SITE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS. HOWEVER, DUE TO PRACTICALITIES, VERY FEW ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE AT IDENTIFYING THE REGIONS AFFECTED BY REGIONAL ACTIVITIES AND CONSIDER THEIR REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SUGGEST THE DIRECTION OF A FORTHCOMING STUDY BY SHOWING THE NECESSITY OF REGIONAL CHARACTERISTIC CONSIDERATION IN REGIONAL EVALUATION, AND TO SUGGEST A SYNTHETIC, REGION-BASED LCA METHOD WHICH CAN REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES OF REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF REGIONAL ACTIVITIES. METHODS. IN THIS STUDY, THE LIFE CYCLE REGION-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT METHOD (LCRAM) WAS PROPOSED AS A NEW SITE-SPECIFIC LCA METHOD. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE USED LCRAM TO OBSERVE THE EFFECTS OF 4 ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS (CO2, NOX, SOX, AND SPM) TO HUMAN HEALTH (DALY) IN 47 REGIONS (PREFECTURES IN JAPAN). LCRAM CONSISTS OF A REGIONAL DATABASE AND AN ANALYSIS METHOD (EIOM). IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING STRUCTURAL (REGIONAL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION, INTERREGIONAL TRADE, AND THE STRUCTURE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION) AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES (GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION, CLIMATE, NATURAL CONDITIONS, AND POPULATION DENSITY), WE FIRST CONSTRUCTED A REGIONAL DATABASE. THIS INCLUDES AN INTERREGIONAL TRADE MATRIX (ITM), REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN COEFFICIENTS (REBC), AND REGIONAL DAMAGE FACTORS (RDF). SECOND, FOR CONSIDERING THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS BY USING THE REGIONAL DATABASE TO THE EACH REGION, IT IS A NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN EMITTING REGIONS (EMITTING REGIONS) OF INDIRECT EFFECTS DUE TO REGIONAL ACTIVITY. TO DO THIS, WE DEVELOPED THE EXPANDED INTERREGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT METHOD (EIOM) TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT METHOD (MULTI-REGIONAL IO) BY APPLYING THE TWO-REGIONAL IO METHOD AND THE ITM. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO APPLY MULTI-REGIONAL IO TO MANY REGIONS AND INDUSTRIES OWING TO PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. UPON COMPARISON BETWEEN THE REGIONAL DATABASE, IT WAS FOUND TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES DUE TO REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE OF REBC INFLUENCES THE EVALUATION RESULTS BY CALCULATING THE DEVIATION EFFECT INDEX WITH REBC AND, THUS, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE EFFECTS FROM THE IRON AND STEEL, AND ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRIES WERE MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES. ALSO THE SIZE OF RDF VARIES ACCORDING TO THE PROPERTY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN (EB) AND REGION; AND THE MORE SITE-SPECIFIC EB, SUCH AS SPM IN THIS STUDY SHOWS, THE MORE DISTINCT THE DIFFERENCE.,THEREFORE, IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO RECOMMEND THAT THE PROPER REGIONAL DATABASE IS APPLIED TO THE EMITTING REGIONS. MEANWHILE, A COMPARISON WITH A 9-REGION IO TABLE (A MULTI-REGIONAL IO TABLE MADE BY THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, TRADE AND INDUSTRY IN JAPAN) WAS PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE RELIABILITY OF EIOM. THE RESULTS INDICATED A HIGH CONSISTENCY OF OVER 95\%, WHICH VERIFIES THAT EIOM CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF A MULTI-REGIONAL IO METHOD. FINALLY, AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN LCRAM AND REGION-GENERIC METHOD (RGM) FOR NINE ACTIVITY REGIONS, WE CONFIRMED THAT THE RESULTS PRODUCED BY RGM MAY BE AN UNDERESTIMATION OR OVERESTIMATION; AS AN EXAMPLE, THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE AMONG THE REGIONS FOR DALY REACHED 48\% OF THE RGM RESULT. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK. IN THIS STUDY, IT WAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE EVALUATION RESULTS WILL BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE STRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES OF EACH REGION. IT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE PROPER REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS TO EVALUATE THE ACTUAL REGIONAL ACTIVITY. LCRAM IS AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO CONSIDER THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS TO REGIONS, THROUGH ALL STAGES OF THE ACTIVITIES. ALSO, IT IS POSSIBLE TO APPLY A REGIONAL EVALUATION FOR MORE REGIONS AND MORE DETAIL IN THE INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION. FURTHERMORE, IT DISCUSSES THE INTERDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPORTATION EFFECTS DUE TO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE REGIONS. THUS, IT MAY ENABLE US TO MAKE AN APPROPRIATE DECISION IN REGION-BASED EVALUATIONS SUCH AS NOURISHMENT AND INDUCEMENT OF INDUSTRY, INFRASTRUCTURE, RECYCLE SYSTEM, ETC. FINALLY, IT IS ALSO EXPECTED THAT FURTHER DISCUSSION AND CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ENABLING US TO FRAME AN ACTUAL AND EFFICIENT POLICY BASED ON THE REGIONAL STRUCTURAL FEATURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES FOR A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY.",""

TARGET AUDIENCES ARE GOVERNMENTAL DECISION MAKERS, INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND RESEARCHERS CONCERNED,WITH THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DECISIONS. METHODS. A REGIONAL VERSION OF THE EXISTING US EIO-LCA MODEL WAS DEVELOPED USING-REGIONAL ECONOMIC MULTIPLIERS AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA. THE NATIONAL MODEL IS BASED ON THE US 491 BY 491 ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL, AND USES SECTORAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSION FACTORS TO APPROXIMATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF PRODUCTION AND SERVICES. THE PROPORTION OF THE REGIONAL VALUE ADDED (GROSS STATE PRODUCT) TO THE NATIONAL VALUE ADDED FOR EACH SECTOR WAS USED TO DEVELOP ECONOMIC MULTIPLIERS TO ALLOCATE THE OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIES TO INDIVIDUAL STATES AND MULTI-STATE REGIONS. INTER-SECTORAL TRANSACTION MATRICES WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR EIGHT REGIONS. REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSION AND RESOURCE USE FACTORS WERE FORMED BASED UPON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA OF THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) AND DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

THE MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT APPROXIMATELY 70\% OF THE TOTAL NATIONAL SECTORAL PRODUCTION TAKES PLACE IN THREE REGIONS, I.E., SOUTH WEST, SOUTH EAST AND FAR WEST, WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THE EIA STATISTICS. THE REIO-LCA MODEL CONSTRUCTED FOR THE FAR WEST IS USED TO CONDUCT A SECOND CASE STUDY ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL TOXIC AIR EMISSIONS OF POWER PLANTS IN THE REGION IN 2003.

THE USEFULNESS OF IO LCA MODELS CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF LOCAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS. WIHT THE LACK OF US REGIONAL SECTORAL DATA, THE ALLOCATION OF NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION TO REGIONS CAN PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO CREATE SMALLER SCALE IO MODELS.

THE QUALITY OF DATA, E.G., AGE AND LEVEL OF AGGREGATION, AND THE ASSUMED LINEARITY BETWEEN SECTORAL OUTPUTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS REPRESENT THE MAIN SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GSP ESTIMATES ARE APPROPRIATE TO CONSTRUCT A FRAMEWORK FOR A REGIONAL ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT MODEL.

SOME REGIONS IN CHINA ARE RELATIVELY POOR WITH REGARDS TO WATER RESOURCES. THIS PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED BY ECONOMIC GROWTH. FLOURISHING TRADE ACTIVITIES ON BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF WATER WITHDRAWAL AND WATER POLLUTION. HENCE THE GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT INTER-REGIONAL TRADE STRUCTURE AND ITS EFFECTS ON WATER CONSUMPTION AND POLLUTION VIA `VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS'. VIRTUAL WATER IS THE WATER EMBEDDED IN PRODUCTS AND USED IN THE WHOLE PRODUCTION CHAIN, AND THAT IS TRADED BETWEEN REGIONS OR EXPORTED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. FOR THIS ASSESSMENT OF TRADE FLOWS AND EFFECTS ON WATER RESOURCES, WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN EXTENDED REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL FOR EIGHT HYDRO-ECONOMIC REGIONS IN CHINA TO ACCOUNT FOR VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH CHINA. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE CURRENT TRADE STRUCTURE IN CHINA IS NOT VERY FAVORABLE WITH REGARDS TO WATER RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND EFFICIENCY. NORTH CHINA AS A WATER SCARCE REGION VIRTUALLY EXPORTS ABOUT 5\% OF ITS TOTAL AVAILABLE FRESHWATER RESOURCES WHILE ACCEPTING LARGE AMOUNTS OF WASTEWATER FOR OTHER REGIONS' CONSUMPTION. BY CONTRAST, SOUTH CHINA A REGION WITH ABUNDANT WATER RESOURCES IS VIRTUALLY IMPORTING WATER FROM OTHER REGIONS WHILE THEIR IMPORTS ARE CREATING WASTE WATER POLLUTING OTHER REGIONS' HYDRO-ECOSYSTEMS.

IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY TO INCORPORATE EXPOSURE AND RISK CONCEPTS INTO LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA). WE ARGUED THAT BOTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND LCIA ARE NEEDED TO CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF INCREASING INSULATION FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES IN THE US FROM CURRENT PRACTICE TO THE LEVELS RECOMMENDED BY THE 2000 INTERNATIONAL ENERGY CONSERVATION CODES. IN THIS ANALYSIS, WE APPLY OUR MODEL TO THE INSULATION CASE STUDY AND EVALUATE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF INCREASED INSULATION FOR NEW HOUSING. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. THE CENTRAL ESTIMATE OF IMPACTS FROM THE COMPLETE INSULATION MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CHAIN IS APPROXIMATELY 20 PREMATURE DEATHS, 500 ASTHMA ATTACKS, AND 8,000 RESTRICTED ACTIVITY DAYS NATIONWIDE FOR ONE YEAR OF INCREASED FIBERGLASS OUTPUT. OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED INSULATION MANUFACTURING, 83\% ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN EMISSIONS FROM THE MINERAL WOOL INDUSTRY, WHICH IS MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIRECT PRIMARY PM2.5 EMISSIONS FROM THE INDUSTRY (98\%). REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION LEADS TO 1.2 PREMATURE DEATHS, 30 ASTHMA ATTACKS, AND 600 RESTRICTED ACTIVITY DAYS AVOIDED PER YEAR, INDICATING A PUBLIC HEALTH `PAYBACK PERIOD' ON THE ORDER OF 14 YEARS. ABOUT 90\% OF THESE BENEFITS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS AND RESIDENTIAL COMBUSTION SOURCES. IN TOTAL, THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS OVER A 50-YEAR PERIOD FOR A SINGLE-YEAR COHORT OF NEW HOMES IS \$100 MILLION WITH A 5\% DISCOUNT RATE, WITH 40 FEWER PREMATURE DEATHS IN THIS PERIOD. CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATION AND OUTLOOK. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND APPLIED A RISK-BASED MODEL TO QUANTIFY THE PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS AND BENEFITS OF INCREASED INSULATION IN NEW SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES IN THE US, DEMONSTRATING POSITIVE NET ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS WITHIN THE LIFETIMES OF THE HOMES. MORE BROADLY, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO INCORPORATE EXPOSURE AND RISK CONCEPTS INTO I-O LCA, RELYING ON REGRESSION-BASED INTAKE FRACTIONS FOLLOWED BY MORE REFINED DISPERSION MODELING. THE REFINEMENT STEP IS RECOMMENDED ESPECIALLY IF PRIMARY PM2.5 IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF EXPOSURE AND IF STACK HEIGHTS ARE RELATIVELY LOW. WHERE SECONDARY PM2.5 IS MORE IMPORTANT, USE OF REGRESS ION-BASED INTAKE FRACTIONS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR A REASONABLE RISK APPROXIMATION. UNCERTAINTIES IN OUR RISK-BASED MODEL SHOULD BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED; NEVERTHELESS, OUR STUDY CAN HELP DECISION-MAKERS EVALUATE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT POLICY OPTIONS FROM A COMBINED PUBLIC HEALTH AND LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE.",""

IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, WE INTEGRATE FINANCIAL INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN ECONOMIC SECTORS, WITH NATIONAL SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTS TO CONSTRUCT NUMERATE `TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE' ACCOUNTS FOR 135 DISCRETE SECTORS. THE ACCOUNTS ARE PORTRAYED AGAINST THE NUMERAIRE OF `ONE DOLLAR OF GDP'.

SOCIAL ASPECTS SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT CAN BE PORTRAYED AS MINUTES OF EMPLOYMENT GENERATED PER DOLLAR. GREENHOUSE ISSUES CAN BE PORTRAYED AS KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMITTED PER DOLLAR. SINCE THESE INDICATORS OF `TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE' PERFORMANCE ARE REFERENCED AGAINST FINANCIAL UNITS AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SYSTEM OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS OF A FIRM, A SERVICE OR A PRODUCT, AND ALLOW A ROBUST TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE ACCOUNT TO BE DEVELOPED ACROSS A RANGE OF SCALES.

THE OTHER, SUGGESTED BY BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) IS BASED ON THE MONETARY VALUES OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, THE INFORMATION RECORDED IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE FORMER FACES THE CHALLENGE OF DISTINGUISHING THE COMMODITIES USED AS INTERMEDIATE INPUT FROM THOSE AS FINAL CONSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH ITS RECENT DEVELOPMENT HAS TRIED TO CALCULATE THE RAW MATERIALS USED DIRECTLY IN TRADED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS (WACKERNAGEL, M., LEWAN, L., HANSSON, C.B., 1999A) IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB BECAUSE THE INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED. USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO CONSIDER THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS OF SUPPORTING FINAL DEMAND, MAY ALLEVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY. BICKNELL ET AL.

CONVENTIONAL COST AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS, AS USED ON MINES, TREAT PRODUCTION SECTORS AS SEPARATE COST CENTRES, AND DO NOT DETERMINE THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM. THIS CAN LEAD TO INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS ON THE RELATIVE VALUE OF SECTORS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE TOTAL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE FACILITY. THIS PAPER EXPLAINS THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, AND PRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF ITS APPLICATION TO A SIMPLISTIC MODEL OF A MINE, WHICH IS USED IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY REAL DATA. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT, BY FORCING DEFINITION OF THE VALUE ADDING FUNCTION OF EACH SECTOR, INPUT OUTPUT ANALYSIS WILL FACILITATE CONTROL OF INPUTS, OR COSTS. THIS WILL RESULT IN OPTIMAL APPLICATION OF RESOURCES AND EXPLOITATION OF ORE RESERVES.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CRITICAL VARIABLES DETERMINING THE FUTURE OF INDONESIA'S FORESTS WILL BE THE OVERALL RATE OF GROWTH OF THE ECONOMY AND THE RATE OF PLANTATION ESTABLISHMENT. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH A MARKED SHIFT TO PLANTATIONS AND ADOPTION OF MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES FOR LOGGING NATURAL FORESTS (BOTH OF WHICH ARE IN PRACTICE UNLIKELY), DEGRADATION OF INDONESIA'S TROPICAL FORESTS WILL BE SEVERE.",""

TO ENABLE THIS ASSESSMENT, IN BARBITURATE-ANESTHETIZED CATS AND URETHANE-ANESTHETIZED RATS JUXTACELLULAR RECORDINGS WERE PERFORMED TOGETHER WITH MICROIONTOPHORETIC EJECTION OF TRANSMITTER AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS. THE EFFECTS OF THESE DRUGS WERE STUDIED ON RESPONSES EVOKED BY MECHANICAL STIMULATION OF CUTANEOUS RECEPTIVE FIELDS (RFS) OF NEURONS IN THE THALAMIC VENTROBASAL COMPLEX (VB). NEURONS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VB WERE INVESTIGATED: 29 UNITS WERE LOCATED MEDIALLY, IN THE VENTRAL POSTEROMEDIAL NUCLEUS (VPM; FACIAL RFS), AND 11 UNITS WERE LOCATED LATERALLY, IN THE VENTRAL POSTEROLATERAL NUCLEUS (VPL; FOREPAW AND BODY RFS). A FURTHER ELEVEN VB UNITS HAD NO DETECTABLE RF. TWENTY-SIX NEURONS WERE TESTED WITH ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX (SI), 17 OF THESE BEING IDENTIFIED AS THALAMO-CORTICAL RELAY NEURONS AND 5 BEING CLASSIFIED AS PRESUMED INTERNEURONS; THE REMAINING 4 COULD NOT BE ACTIVATED. FOUR ADDITIONAL RECORDINGS WERE FROM TRIGEMINO-THALAMIC OR THALAMO-CORTICAL FIBERS. FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE NEURONS' INPUT AND OUTPUT, NEURONAL ACTIVITY WAS INDUCED BY FEEDBACK-CONTROLLED, MECHANICAL TRAPEZOIDAL AND/OR SINUSOIDAL STIMULI APPLIED TO SINUS HAIRS, FUR OR SKIN AND THE NUMBERS OF PREPOTENTIALS AND SOMA SPIKES WERE COMPARED IN PERISTIMULUS TIME HISTOGRAMS (PSTHS) GENERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR BOTH TYPES OF SIGNAL FROM `DC' RECORDINGS. IONTOPHORETIC ADMINISTRATION OF EXCITATORY AMINO ACIDS (EAAS) OR BICUCULLINE METHIODIDE (BMI) INCREASED OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS IN 87\% OF THE CASES TESTED, DUE TO A HIGHER RATE OF CONVERSION OF PREPOTENTIALS INTO SOMA SPIKES TAKING PLACE. IN CASES OF NEURONS EXHIBITING A SUSTAINED-TO-TRANSIENT RESPONSE PATTERN, CHANGES TO SUSTAINED-TO-SUSTAINED PATTERNS WERE DEMONSTRATED. TESTS WITH GAMMAAMINOBUTYRIC ACID (GABA) PRODUCED DECREASED OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS IN 90\% OF THE NEURONS, DUE TO A LOWER CONVERSION RATE OF PREPOTENTIALS INTO SOMA SPIKES TAKING PLACE. IN CASES OF NEURONS EXHIBITING HIGH OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS (SUSTAINED-TO-SUSTAINED TYPE), THE RESPONSES CHANGED TO THE SUSTAINED-TO-TRANSIENT PATTERN. FOR CORTICALLY EVOKED ANTIDROMIC SPIKES OF VB NEURONS, GABA PRODUCED A FAILURE OF THE INITIAL SEGMENT (IS-) SPIKE TO INVADE THE SOMA, WHEREAS BMI AND GLUTAMATE (GLU) FACILITATED SOMA DEPOLARIZATION. WHEN EJECTED WITH RELATIVELY HIGHER CURRENTS THAN THOSE NEEDED TO ALTER OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS, EAAS DECREASED PREPOTENTIAL AMPLITUDES WHILE GABA PRODUCED INCREASES IN 16 OF 18 NEURONS. CONCURRENT ADMINISTRATION OF BOTH TYPES (EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY) OF AMINO ACID YIELDED ENHANCED SOMA SPIKE ACTIVITY DUE TO GLU, CONCOMITANT WITH THE ENLARGED PREPOTENTIAL AMPLITUDE CAUSED BY GABA. TETRODOTOXIN (TTX) REVERSIBLY ABOLISHED SOMA SPIKES IN 9 OF 11 CASES (BUT NOT FIBER SPIKES). EAA ANTAGONISTS EXERTED NO EFFECT UPON OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS OR UPON SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION. GLU AND BMI BOTH SHORTENED THE CONVERSION TIME BETWEEN PREPOTENTIAL AND SOMA SPIKE AND INCREASED THE SPIKE DISCHARGE RATE. WHEREAS BMI DID SO IN A STIMULUS- AND INPUT-RELATED MANNER, HIGH DOSES OF GLU CAUSED A CONTINUOUS ONGOING DISCHARGE UNTIL ALL SPIKE ACTIVITY STOPPED DUE TO DEPOLARIZATION BLOCK. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE OUTPUT OF THALAMIC VB NEURONS IS CONTROLLED BY GABA-MEDIATED INHIBITORY PROCESSES, LIKELY OPERATING AT THE INITIAL SEGMENT OF THE AXON. THIS HOLDS FOR THALAMO-CORTICAL RELAY NEURONS AND PRESUMED THALAMIC INTERNEURONS. TWO PROCESSES APPEAR TO BE IN ACTION: AN INTRINSIC MECHANISM THAT OPERATES TONICALLY IN VB TO GENERALLY CONSTRAIN THE OUTPUT OF NATURALLY-DRIVEN NEURONS, AND A SECOND MECHANISM THAT INFLUENCES THE STRENGTH OF THIS GABA-MEDIATED INHIBITION, THEREBY GENERATING CHANGES IN THE RESPONSE REPERTOIRE OF THE NEURONS. THIS PROCESS APPEARS TO BE TO A LARGE EXTENT UNDER THE CONTROL OF INPUTS FROM THE NEURONS' PERIPHERAL RECEPTIVE FIELD.",""

WE COMPARED THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF P INPUT REGIMES ON YIELD, N AND P BUDGETS, AND SOIL P AVAILABILITY IN FOUR CONSECUTIVE SOYBEAN CROPS IN A 2-YEAR PERIOD ON A HUMOXIC TROPOHUMULT. IN EACH CROP CYCLE, NODULATING (NOD) AND NONNODULATING (NONNOD) ISOLINES WERE SUBPLOTS IN P-REGIME MAINPLOTS (KG P HA-1 BY CROP CYCLE): P0= CONTROL WITHOUT P INPUTS; LP= 50, 35, 35, 35; MP= 100, 70, 70, 70; AND HP= 300, 210, 210, 210. SEED YIELDS OF THE NOD ISOLINE IN THE HP REGIME WERE 3700 KG HA-1 IN THE TWO SUMMER SEASONS AND 2400 TO 2500 KG HA-1 IN THE FALL SEASONS, WITH A MEAN INCREASE OF 85\% COMPARED TO YIELDS OF THE NOD P0 CONTROL. NONNOD SEED YIELDS AND N ACCUMULATION WERE UNAFFECTED BY THE P REGIME, AVERAGING 870 AND 48 KG HA-1, RESPECTIVELY. THE CONTRIBUTION OF BNF TO NOD SOYBEAN N ASSIMILATION WAS LINEARLY RELATED TO P UPTAKE, AND MEAN P UPTAKE BY NOD PLANTS WAS 60\% GREATER THAN BY NONNOD SOYBEAN, DESPITE 35\% GREATER ROOT LENGTH OF NONNOD PLANTS AT 0-50 CM DEPTH. FOR THE FOUR CROP CYCLES, TOTAL BNF INPUT TO THE SYSTEM RANGED FROM 330 KG N HA-1 (P0). OR 65\% OF TOTAL ABOVEGROUND N, TO 710 KG N HA-1 (HP), WHICH WAS 78\% OF TOTAL ABOVEGROUND N. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR P REMOVAL AT HARVEST, A NET P INPUT OF JUST 99 KG P HA-1 AFTER FOUR CROPS INCREASED CUMULATIVE SEED YIELD BY 3600 KG HA-1 AND BNF BY 227 KG N HA-1 IN THE LP TREATMENT. A POSITIVE NET P BALANCE ALSO RESULTED IN (1) AN INCREASE IN EXTRACTABLE P IN THE 0 TO 25 CM TOPSOIL, (2) A REDUCTION IN THE PROPORTION OF P THAT WOULD BE FIXED FROM SUBSEQUENT ADDITIONS AS INDICATED BY A SHIFTED P SORPTION ISOTHERM, AND (3) GREATER APPARENT P UPTAKE EFFICIENCY FROM APPLIED FERTILIZER IN SUBSEQUENT CROP CYCLES.

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THIS MAGNITUDE EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO CONSIDER THE LONGER-TERM NUTRIENT BALANCE OF THE CROP SYSTEM IN DEVELOPING COST-EFFECTIVE P MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ON HIGHLY WEATHERED SOILS.

THIS PAPER ADDRESSES TWO MAIN QUESTIONS: (1) HOW DO NON-FOSSIL ELECTRICITY INVESTMENTS IMPACT CO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA? AND (2) HOW ARE SUCH IMPACTS DISTRIBUTED WITHIN CHINA? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, WE USE A HYBRID, MULTI-REGION, INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) MODEL TO ASSESS THE EMISSION IMPACTS OF INVESTMENTS COMPARED WITH IMPACTS DURING THE OPERATION OF GENERATORS. AS THERE WAS A LARGE SURGE IN THE INSTALLED CAPACITY DURING THE ANALYSIS PERIOD (2002-2010) WE CONSIDERED A COUNTERFACTUAL SCENARIO IN WHICH NON-FOSSIL ELECTRICITY EXPANSION DID NOT OCCUR, AND WHERE GENERATION FOLLOWED HISTORICAL PATTERNS (I.E. USING FOSSIL ENERGY). RESULTS INDICATE THAT NON-FOSSIL ELECTRICITY INVESTMENTS RESULTED IN A NET EMISSION INCREASE OF 16.21 MT, 28.71 MT AND 47.29 MT IN 2002, 2007 AND 2010 RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE NET EMISSION REDUCTION DURING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE OF ELECTRICITY GENERATION WAS, RESPECTIVELY, 48.84 MT, 81.83 MT AND 129.48 MT PER YEAR. NON-FOSSIL ELECTRICITY INVESTMENTS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF EMISSIONS IN THE NORTHERN, NORTHEASTERN AND NORTHWESTERN REGIONS DUE TO A RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF WIND POWER. IN GENERAL, DUE TO SUPPLY CHAINS, DEVELOPED REGIONS (E.G. EAST CHINA) OUTSOURCE THE CARBON IMPACTS OF NON-FOSSIL ELECTRICITY INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOPING REGIONS (CENTRAL AND NORTH CHINA).

THE SCARCE WATER IS QUANTIFIED BY MULTIPLYING THE WATER USE IN PRODUCTION WITH THE WATER STRESS INDEX (WSI). WE ASSESSED THE SCARCE WATER SAVING/LOSS THROUGH INTERPROVINCIAL TRADE WITHIN CHINA USING A MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE FROM 2010.

WE COMPARED THE TWO COUNTRIES' DIRECT AND COMPLETE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS INTENSITY AND BILATERAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES SUCH AS IMPORTS AND EXPORTS, PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION TO ANALYZE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE INTENSITIES OF CARBON EMISSIONS IN ALL SECTORS OF CHINA WERE HIGHER THAN THAT IN JAPAN AND THAT CHINA'S ANNUAL PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS WERE GREATER THAN CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS, THE OPPOSITE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS IN JAPAN. CHINA WAS A TYPICAL NET CARBON EXPORT COUNTRY, AND CARBON EMBODIED IN ITS IMPORTS AND EXPORTS CONTINUED TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD. IN CONTRAST, JAPAN'S VOLUME AND GROWTH RATE OF EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS WERE FAR LESS THAN CHINA'S AND JAPAN WAS A TYPICAL NET CARBON IMPORT COUNTRY.

THE COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE IMPACTS OF SIX MSW TREATMENT SYSTEMS IN CHINA ARE EVALUATED USING THIS METHOD: (1) LANDFILLING, (2) LANDFILLING WITH LANDFILL GAS UTILIZATION, (3) INCINERATION WITH LEACHATE SPRAY, (4) COMPOSTING + LANDFILLING, (5) COMPOSTING + INCINERATION, AND (6) INCINERATION WITH LEACHATE CENTRALIZED TREATMENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT COMPOSTING + INCINERATION HAS THE LOWEST RESOURCE IMPACTS EXCEPT FOR RAW COAL EXTRACTION. REUSING BY-PRODUCTS OF MSW TREATMENT SYSTEMS CAN REDUCE RESOURCE EXTRACTION OF THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. BY REUSING THE BY-PRODUCTS, LANDFILLING INDUCES THE LARGEST EXTRACTION OF FOSSIL FUELS AND BIOMASS, WHEREAS LANDFILLING WITH LANDFILL GAS UTILIZATION INDUCES THE LARGEST EXTRACTION OF MINERAL ORES. IMPROVING THE DIESEL EFFICIENCY OF THE COLLECTION AND TRANSPORTATION PROCESS, INCREASING BY-PRODUCT RECOVERY EFFICIENCY, AND DECREASING MOISTURE CONTENT OF MSW HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON REDUCING RESOURCE IMPACTS OF MSW TREATMENT SYSTEMS. WE ALSO OBSERVED TRADE-OFFS IN RESOURCE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT MSW TREATMENT SYSTEMS. COMPARED TO LANDFILLING, LANDFILLING WITH LANDFILL GAS UTILIZATION CAN REDUCE THE INDUCED FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION BUT INCREASE THE INDUCED METAL ORE EXTRACTION.

CITIES ARE THUS A COMPLEX ARTICULATION THAT INTERTWINE LOCAL AND GLOBAL CHALLENGES WHICH RELY AT THEIR EXTENDED HINTERLAND FOR THEIR RESOURCE USE AND POLLUTION EMISSION. TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF AN URBAN AREA IN A COMPREHENSIVE MANNER, IT IS NOT ONLY NECESSARY TO MEASURE ITS LOCAL AND DIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ITS GLOBAL AND INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL COUNTERPARTS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF A TERRITORIAL-BASED AND A CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH TO ESTIMATE BOTH DIRECT AND EMBODIED RESOURCE USE AND POLLUTION FLOWS FOR THE CASE OF BRUSSELS CAPITAL REGION (BELGIUM). THE TERRITORIAL-BASED APPROACH IS BASED ON LOCAL ENERGY, WATER AND MATERIAL CONSUMPTION MEASURED DATA AS WELL AS MEASURED DATA ON WASTE GENERATION AND POLLUTION EMISSIONS. THE ESTIMATION OF INDIRECT RESOURCE USE AND POLLUTION EMISSIONS (OR CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH) IS BASED ON THE REGIONAL 10-TABLES OF THE CITY-REGION OF BRUSSELS EXTENDED WITH MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GLOBAL FLOWS OF CONSUMPTION. THE COMPARISON OF THESE TWO APPROACHES IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN THE CASE OF CITIES THAT HAVE LIMITED PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES AND LIMITED OR NO EXTRACTION OF MATERIALS AS THE IMPACT ON THE HINTERLAND IS OFTEN UNDERESTIMATED OR NEGLECTED BY LOCAL (ENVIRONMENTAL) POLICIES WHICH ARE ONLY BASED ON TERRITORIAL BASED FIGURES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE INDIRECT PRIMARY ENERGY USE, GHG EMISSIONS AND MATERIAL USE ESTIMATED BY THE CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN LOCAL MEASURES INDICATE. THE EMBODIED WATER USE, ESTIMATED VIA IOA, WAS OVER 40 TIMES HIGHER THAN THE LOCAL WATER CONSUMPTION. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT TERRITORIAL-BASED APPROACH USING LOCAL DATA UNDERESTIMATE THE RESOURCE NEEDS AND POLLUTION EMISSIONS OF A CITY AND CAN THEREFORE BE INSUFFICIENT OR EVEN BE MISGUIDING. BY MAPPING THE ORIGIN OF EMBODIED FLOWS IT IS IN FACT POSSIBLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE OPEN CHARACTER OF AN URBAN ECONOMY AND ITS DEPENDENCE ON THE GLOBAL HINTERLAND. FINALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE POSSIBILITY AND RELEVANCE TO COMBINE THESE TWO APPROACHES TO CREATE A HYBRID FRAMEWORK THAT MEASURES THE FULL ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF CITIES BOTH ACCURATELY AND COMPREHENSIVELY.

MILD OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION (MOFC) COMBINES THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MODERATE AND INTENSE LOW-OXYGEN DILUTION (MILD) COMBUSTION AND OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION (OFC) TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY JUSTIFIED CO2 CAPTURE FROM FOSSIL FUEL-BASED POWER GENERATION. THE ADVANTAGES OF MOFC APPLICATION ARE: (I) IT INCREASES THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COAL-FIRED BOILER, (II) IT INCREASES THE PURITY OF THE CO2 IN THE FLUE GASES, (III) IT REDUCES THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION OF THE BOILER BY USING LOWER OXIDISER EXCESS, AND (IV) IT REDUCES THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION ASSOCIATED WITH CO2 RECIRCULATION. THEREFORE, USING MOFC DECREASES THE PENALTY OF THE OVERALL NET ENERGY EFFICIENCY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CO2 CAPTURE FROM COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS IN THIS STUDY CONSIDERED THE TEC, WHICH MEASURES THE DEPLETION OF NON-RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES BY ESTIMATING THE CUMULATIVE EXERGY CONSUMED BY THE PRODUCTION PROCESSES. MOREOVER, THE ADDITIONAL EXERGY CONSUMPTION THAT COMPENSATES FOR THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF HARMFUL EMISSIONS HAS ALSO BEEN CONSIDERED.

THIS RAPID URBANIZATION HAS STIMULATED THE GROWTH OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION. TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF URBANIZATION ON CHINESE HOUSEHOLDS' ENERGY CONSUMPTION, THIS PAPER ANALYZED THE CHANGES IN HOUSEHOLDS' DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION (DEC) AND CALCULATED HOUSEHOLDS' INDIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION (IEC) BASED ON AN ENERGY INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. BY APPLYING AN INPUT-OUTPUT STRUCTURE DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS MODEL, THIS PAPER QUANTITATIVELY MEASURED THE IMPACTS OF URBANIZATION ON THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF HOUSEHOLDS IN CHINA. WE FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF CHINA'S URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' DEC GRADUALLY INCREASED FROM 48.7 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT TO 185.2 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT. IN 2012, THE PROPORTION OF COAL PRODUCTS IN URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' DEC DECREASED FROM 91.4\% IN 1980 TO 24.3\%, WHILE THE PROPORTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, AND ELECTRICITY IN URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' DEC INCREASED. DURING 1980 TO 2012, CHINA'S RURAL HOUSEHOLDS' DEC INCREASED FROM 36.7 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT TO 121.5 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT. HOWEVER, THE PROPORTION OF COAL PRODUCTS WAS STILL GREATER THAN 50\% IN 2012. CHINESE HOUSEHOLDS' IEC INCREASED FROM 302.8 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT IN 1987 TO 769.9 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT IN 2010. IN ADDITION, CHINA'S URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' IEC HAD A FASTER GROWTH RATE THAN CHINA'S RURAL HOUSEHOLDS' IEC. URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' IEC INCREASED FROM 139.0 MILLION TONS IN 1987 TO 599.8 MILLION TONS IN 2010, WHILE RURAL HOUSEHOLDS' IEC FLUCTUATED DURING THE SAME PERIOD, WITH 163.8 MILLION TONS IN 1987, 132.2 MILLION TONS IN 2000, AND 170.1 MILLION TONS IN 2010. AMONG THE IMPACT FACTORS OF HOUSEHOLDS' DEC, WHICH INCLUDE THE POPULATION, URBANIZATION RATE, URBAN/RURAL HOUSEHOLDS' DEC PER CAPITA AND URBAN/RURAL HOUSEHOLDS' DEC STRUCTURE, CHINA'S TOTAL POPULATION HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON HOUSEHOLDS' DEC GROWTH. THE URBANIZATION RATE IS THE OTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR CONSTANTLY STIMULATING CHINA'S HOUSEHOLDS' DEC GROWTH. FOR HOUSEHOLDS' IEC, THE URBANIZATION RATE AND PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLDS' IEC.

THE MAIN FINDINGS OBTAINED WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) CHINA WAS THE LARGEST CO2 EXPORTER TO OTHER COUNTRIES, ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 20 \% OF GLOBAL EXPORTS SINCE 2005; THE CO2 EXPORTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (USA), GERMANY, AND JAPAN VARIED SLIGHTLY OVER THIS TIME PERIOD, BUT OVERALL, THEIR PROPORTIONS HAD DECREASED. (2) THE CO2 IMPORTS OF THE USA WERE THE LARGEST, OCCUPYING AROUND 20 \% OF THE GLOBAL CO2 IMPORTS; MEANWHILE, CHINA'S CO2 IMPORTS INCREASED RAPIDLY AND RANKED THE SECOND LARGEST. (3) FOR CHINESE TAIWAN, ITS PROPORTION OF CO2 EXPORTS IN PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS RANKED THE HIGHEST WHILE THAT OF THE USA RANKED THE LOWEST; HIGHLY CO2 IMPORT-DEPENDENT COUNTRIES WITH AN OVER 40 \% PROPORTION OF CO2 IMPORTS IN ITS CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS INCLUDED FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, AND SPAIN, WHILE CHINA, INDIA, AND RUSSIA REMAINED THE LOWEST, DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR PHYSICAL ENERGY IMPORTS.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE DEMANDS OF CONSTRUCTION, TRANSPORT AND OTHER SERVICES DOMINATED THE EMISSIONS FROM THE CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVE, FOLLOWED BY ELECTRIC POWER AND SOME MACHINERY AND LIGHT INDUSTRIES. THE VARYING TRENDS OF AIR POLLUTANTS FROM 2007 TO 2012 WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-BASED CONTROL MEASURES AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AND TRADING PATTERNS. FROM THE CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO THE STRINGENT CONTROL OF SO2 IN POWER PLANTS AND KEY INDUSTRIES, THE SO2 EMISSIONS UNDERWENT SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES, WHILE THE LESS CONTROLLED PM10, PM25, VOC AND CO EMISSIONS CONTINUED TO GROW. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CLEANER (THAT IS, WITH LOWER EMISSION INTENSITY) SERVICE SECTORS (THIRD-SECTOR INDUSTRIES, EXCLUDING TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND POST) TO ALL SEVEN POLLUTANTS INCREASED. THIS INCREASE COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE SECTOR IN GUANGDONG; IN THIS FIVE-YEAR PERIOD, THE SERVICE SECTOR GREW BY 41\% IN TERMS OF ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO GUANGDONG'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.

THE METHOD OF STRUCTURE DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS (SDA) IS APPLIED TO QUANTIFY THE CHANGES IN THE SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF EMBODIED CARBON TRADE IN CHINA, INDIA, JAPAN, AND THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, THE TOP THREE COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST EMBODIED CARBON TRADE WERE: THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND JAPAN IN 1995, AND THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND INDIA IN 2009. IN 1995 AND 2009, THE SECTORS WHICH HAVE THE HIGHEST DIRECT CARBON EMISSION COEFFICIENTS AND TOTAL CARBON EMISSION COEFFICIENTS IN CHINA, INDIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE ELECTRICITY, GAS AND WATER SUPPLY SECTORS, WHILE EACH COUNTRY MAINTAINED A DIFFERENT COEFFICIENT. A DECREASE OF DIRECT CARBON EMISSION COEFFICIENT WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF THE IMPORTS AND EXPORTS, AS WELL AS THE SELF-CONSUMPTION OF EMBODIED CARBON. THEREFORE, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT COUNTRIES SHOULD DEVELOP LOW-CARBON INDUSTRIES, AND REDUCE THE CARBON EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF OUTPUT.

WITH THE SUPPORT OF AVERAGED EORA GLOBAL EMBODIED WATER INTENSITY DATABASES FOR THE WORLD AND CHINESE ECONOMIES, A THREE-SCALE EMBODIED WATER INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS OF THE BEIJING ECONOMY IN 2007 HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. DOZENS OF VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS THAT RELATE TO THE BEIJING ECONOMY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ANALYZED. ONLY 15\% OF THE TOTAL WATER RESOURCES EMBODIED IN BEIJING'S LOCAL FINAL DEMAND WERE FROM LOCAL WATER WITHDRAWAL; 85\% WERE FROM DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY IMPORTED PRODUCTS. THE VIRTUAL WATER IMPORT IS REVEALED TO PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE THAN PHYSICAL WATER TRANSFER IN EASING BEIJING'S WATER SHORTAGE. SINCE THE AVERAGE WATER USE EFFICIENCY OF THE BEIJING ECONOMY IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY BUT SOMEWHAT LOWER THAT OF THE REST OF THE WORLD, BEIJING IS SUGGESTED TO SHIFTING ITS IMPORTS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO OPTIMIZE GLOBAL WATER USE.

THE GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE GLOBAL UNDERNOURISHMENT AND AGRICULTURAL LAND DISPLACEMENT, USING MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND USED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CROPS TRADED BETWEEN 133 COUNTRIES AND REGIONS. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT UNDERNOURISHED REGIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPORT MORE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL LAND, WHICH IS LAND USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES, THAN THEY IMPORT. ON THE OTHER HAND, REGIONS NOT SUFFERING FROM UNDERNOURISHMENT GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER IMPORTS OF EMBODIED LAND.

THE METHOD PROPOSED COMBINES THE MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL WITH SPANISH NATIONAL DATA ON HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION ACCORDING TO SOCIAL GROUP. MATERIAL FOOTPRINT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE 2008 ECONOMIC CRISIS. IN RELATIVE TERMS, THE SHARE OF SPANISH HOUSEHOLDS' MATERIAL FOOTPRINT, WITH RESPECT TO TOTAL MATERIAL FOOTPRINT, DECREASED DRASTICALLY FROM 70.7\% IN 2006 TO 50.8\% IN 2011. THIS REDUCTION CAN BE MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR CRASH (34.4\% OF THE REDUCTION IS DUE TO CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS), FOLLOWED BY BIOMASS (29\%), METALS (27.1\%) AND FOSSIL FUELS (26.1\%). BY TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD, THE MATERIAL FOOTPRINT EXHIBITS A SCALE EFFECT WHILE CONSUMPTION AND INCOME LEVELS GROW; AND THIS IS ACCOMPANIED BY A GLOBAL TELECONNECTION EFFECT, WHICH VARIES FROM 62\% FOR BIOMASS, TO 64\% FOR METALS, TO 82\% FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, TO 95\% FOR FOSSIL FUELS. GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASING INCOME INEQUALITY, WE PERFORM ONE REDISTRIBUTION SIMULATION FROM HIGH TO MIDDLE- AND LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS, FINDING A MATERIAL FOOTPRINT INCREASE IN ALL CASES. THE MOST MATERIALIZED CONSUMER BASKET IS THAT CORRESPONDING TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN 1500 AND 1999 EUROS. ABOVE THAT INCOME LEVEL, THE GROWING WEIGHT OF EXPENDITURES ON SERVICES REDUCES THE USE OF MATERIALS.

AT THE SAME TIME THE PRESSURE TO CONSIDER SOCIAL ISSUES IN GLOBAL AND INTERCONNECTED SUPPLY CHAINS HAS RISEN AS WELL. THESE ISSUES POSE RISK TO SUPPLY CHAINS SINCE THEIR OCCURRENCE MAY CAUSE ADVERSE STAKEHOLDER REACTION THROUGH E.G. REPUTATIONAL LOSSES. DESPITE THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT AS A KEY PROCESS WITHIN SUPPLY CHAINS AND THE FREQUENTLY ARTICULATED DEMAND FOR A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ASSOCIATED RISKS, SUCH APPROACHES ARE MISSING SO FAR. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO EFFICIENTLY ESTIMATE AND ASSESS SOCIAL RISKS ALONG GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, LEONTIEF'S INPUT OUTPUT MODEL IS COMBINED WITH COUNTRY RISKS AND SECTOR SPECIFIC LABOUR INTENSITIES. IN ADDITION, A FUZZY ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS IS USED TO WEIGH THE VARIOUS CONSIDERED SOCIAL RISKS. THEREBY THE FOCUS IS ON THE UPSTREAM SUPPLY CHAIN OF ACTORS IN A SUPPLY CHAIN. THE APPROACH IS DEVELOPED GENERALLY, OPENING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADAPTION TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INPUT-OUTPUT DATA BASES AND USING DIFFERENT SOCIAL RISKS DISCUSSED IN SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT. THE FUZZY ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS FACILITATES THE OPERATIONAL APPLICATION IN COMPANIES, WHERE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERING PREFERENCES ARE INVOLVED, E.G. IN PROCUREMENT DECISIONS. THE MODEL IS APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OF A GERMAN PREMIUM CAR MANUFACTURER TO DEMONSTRATE AND VALIDATE THE APPROACH. IT IS SHOWN, HOW - BASED ON THE DEVELOPED MODEL - THE ASSESSMENT OF SUPPLY CHAINS RISKS CAN BE CARRIED OUT. THE APPROACH ALLOWS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS A WHOLE, I.E. CONSIDERING ALL UPSTREAM TIERS, AND OF SPECIFIC TIERS. FURTHERMORE, A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO THE OBTAINED WEIGHTS IS CONDUCTED TO VERIFY THE FINAL AGGREGATIVE RISK VALUES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE HUGE DIFFERENCES IN THE SOCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS DIFFERENT RISK STRUCTURES ALONG THE N-TIER CHAIN.

IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AFTER SEQUENTIAL POLICY INTERVENTIONS, ECOLOGICALLY-BASED LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS (ECO-LCA) INVENTORIES WHICH INCLUDE DATA ON RESOURCE CONSUMPTION, EMISSIONS, ECOSYSTEM GOODS AND SERVICES RELATED TO THE U.S. ECONOMIC SECTORS ARE ADOPTED. THE ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK IS IDEALLY SUITED TO MODEL THE INTERLINKAGES BETWEEN A RANGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND DETAILED STRUCTURAL ECONOMIC INFORMATION AT THE SECTOR LEVEL FOR THE ANALYSIS OF ENERGY POLICIES. THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK CAN BE UTILIZED AS A TOOL FOR LEVERAGING THE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY TRADE-OFF DECISIONS WHICH CONSIDER THE IMPACTS TO RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT, IF A SHARE OF THE GASOLINE TAX REVENUE IS REINVESTED TO SUBSIDIZE BIOFUEL PRODUCTION, ECONOMY WIDE RESOURCE CONSUMPTIONS AND EMISSIONS FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL RELATED SUPPLY CHAINS WILL DECREASE. HOWEVER, ECOSYSTEM GOODS AND SERVICES SUCH AS SOIL EROSION, WATER CONSUMPTION FOR AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK, CROPLAND, NITROGEN DEPOSITION ALONG WITH THE EMISSIONS SUCH AS NITROUS OXIDE AND AMMONIA WILL INCREASE IN SHORT TERM AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PRICE DROP AND THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR BIOFUELS.

HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE FISHING SECTOR AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES OTHER MARINE RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS AQUACULTURE, TOURISM, OFF SHORE OIL AND GAS, PORTS, AND TRANSPORT (COLLECTIVELY CALLED THE MARINE SECTOR) ARE GROWING INSTEAD. THE INDUSTRY MAKEUP OF THE MARINE SECTOR IS CHANGING, WHICH PRESENTS CHALLENGES TO SOME COASTAL COMMUNITIES FORCED TO RESHAPE THEIR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND DIVERSIFY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO OF MARINE INDUSTRIES. DOING SO REQUIRES INTRICATELY LINKED NETWORKS OF BUSINESSES AND SERVICES, POTENTIALLY ACROSS INDUSTRIES, THAT EACH RELY ON A FLOW OF INPUTS FROM THEIR SUPPLIERS AND DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRIES TO TAKE THEIR PRODUCT.

THIS VALUE IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY (US\$1.8 MILLION) FOR AN ENERGY EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF GASOLINE. THE INTEGRATION OF FIRST- AND SECOND-GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION: 14.6 VERSUS 86.4 GRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT PER MEGAJOULE (G CO2-EQ/MJ) FOR GASOLINE.

THUS, ISSUES RELATED TO CO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA HAVE BEEN WIDELY STUDIED. HOWEVER, THE INDUSTRIAL LINKAGES OF CO2 EMISSIONS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN LESS CONCERNED. THIS STUDY INTEGRATES HYPOTHETICAL EXTRACTION METHOD WITH THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL, AND INVESTIGATES INDUSTRIAL CO2 EMISSION LINKAGES OF CHINA AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. BASED ON THE DATA OF CHINA IN 2007, WHICH DECOMPOSES CHINA INTO EIGHT REGIONS, THIS STUDY FIRST ANALYZES THE PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSION (PBE) AND CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSION (CBE) OF EACH REGION. THE PBE AND CBE OF 10 BRANCHES ARE THEN ANALYZED AND DECOMPOSED INTO THREE PARTS. FINALLY, THIS STUDY DECOMPOSES THE EXTERNALLY PRODUCED EMBODIED EMISSION (EPEE) AND INTERNALLY PRODUCED EMBODIED EMISSION (IPEE) OF PETROCHEMICALS AND MINERALS IN THE EAST COAST, TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THESE TWO INDICATORS OF A BRANCH AFFECT OTHER BRANCHES IN THE ECONOMY. RESULTS SHOW THAT REGIONS WITH LARGE PBE, SUCH AS COASTAL REGIONS AND CENTRAL, USUALLY HAVE LARGE CBE, WHEREAS JING-JIN HAS THE SMALLEST PBE AND CBE. BRANCHES SUCH AS MINING AND PETROCHEMICALS AND MINERALS, HAVE LARGE PBE AND ARE NET CO2 EMISSION EXPORTERS; WHILE CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER SERVICES ARE NET IMPORTERS. ACCORDING TO THE DECOMPOSITION RESULTS OF PBE AND CBE, BRANCHES CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR GROUPS. THE DECOMPOSED IPEE AND EPEE OF PETROCHEMICALS AND MINERALS IN THE EAST COAST SHOW THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF REGIONS, CO2 EMISSIONS THIS BRANCH EXPORTS TO AND IMPORTS FROM EAST COAST ARE MOST. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BRANCHES, DECOMPOSITION OF IPEE SHOWS THAT PETROCHEMICALS AND MINERALS IN THE EAST COAST EXPORTS A LARGE AMOUNT OF CO2 EMISSIONS TO CONSTRUCTION, WHILE THE DECOMPOSITION RESULTS OF EPEE SHOW THAT THE STUDIED BRANCH IMPORTS LEAST CO2 EMISSIONS FROM CONSTRUCTION.

THE RECENT POPULATION GROWTH, RAPID URBANIZATION, AND FAST INDUSTRIALIZATION PRESENT INCREASING CHALLENGES FOR CHINA'S AGRICULTURAL WATER USE. EMBODIED WATER HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS A SUBSTANTIAL INDICATOR FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF WATER CONSUMPTION INDUCED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE DYNAMIC CHANGE IN EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER USE BY TIME-SERIES DATA. THE FINDINGS OF SUCH STUDIES MAY FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABLE WATER-USAGE STRATEGIES. THUS, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES THE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER TRADE, AS WELL AS PRODUCTION-AND CONSUMPTION-BASED AGRICULTURAL WATER FOOTPRINTS IN CHINA BY USING AN INPUT OUTPUT MODEL DURING 1997-2010. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, CHINA'S AVERAGE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER INTENSITY SHOWS A DECLINING TREND FROM 43.33 M(3)/THOUSAND YUAN IN 1997 TO 32.66 M(3)/ THOUSAND YUAN IN 2010. THE AVERAGE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER INTENSITY OF THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INDUSTRIES. CHINA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NET EXPORTER OF AGRICULTURAL WATER. AT THE INDUSTRIAL LEVEL, THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS A NET IMPORTER BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING FOOD DEMAND IN CHINA, THE SECONDARY INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN A NET EXPORTER, AND THE TERTIARY INDUSTRY HAS MAINTAINED A TRADE BALANCE. THE PRODUCTION-AND CONSUMPTION-BASED EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER USES DEMONSTRATE SIMILAR CHANGING TRENDS: BOTH DECREASE FROM 1997 TO 2007 AND THEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IN 2010. THE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER CONSUMED BY THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY SHOWS A DOWNWARD TREND, WHEREAS THOSE CONSUMED BY THE SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INDUSTRIES DEMONSTRATE AN OPPOSITE TREND. THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL WATER EFFICIENCY, ADJUSTMENTS IN CONSUMPTION AND TRADE STRUCTURE ARE HIGHLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE CONSERVATION OF LOCAL AGRICULTURAL WATER RESOURCES.

THIS DEMONSTRATES THE GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO DEAL WITH CARBON EMISSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. ALTHOUGH THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS NOT A CARBON EMISSION-INTENSIVE INDUSTRY, ITS LARGE SCALE MAKES THE EMISSION REDUCTION IN THE INDUSTRY VERY IMPORTANT. BASED ON THE INPUT OUTPUT STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION METHOD, THIS PAPER CALCULATES THE CO2 EMISSIONS OF CHINA'S FOOD INDUSTRY FROM 1991 TO 2012, AND DECOMPOSES THE CHANGE IN CO2 EMISSIONS OF THE INDUSTRY DURING 1992-1997, 1997-2002, 2002-2007 AND 2007-2010 INTO FOUR MAIN EFFECTS: EMISSION FACTOR, ENERGY STRUCTURE, ENERGY INTENSITY, AND TOTAL OUTPUT (INCLUDING FOUR SUB-EFFECTS: INTERMEDIATE USE, DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, IMPORT SUBSTITUTION AND EXPORT EXTENSION). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHANGES IN CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY MAINLY DEPENDS ON TOTAL OUTPUT EFFECT AND ENERGY INTENSITY EFFECT. ENERGY INTENSITY EFFECT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS, AS IT REDUCED CUMULATIVE 213 MILLION TONS (MT) CO2 EMISSIONS OF THE INDUSTRY. AMONG TOTAL OUTPUT EFFECT, THE EFFECTS OF INTERMEDIATE USE AND DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND ARE THE TWO BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO CARBON EMISSIONS.

RESULTS SHOW THAT FOR MANY ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) AND A FEW DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, HOUSEHOLD METABOLISM HAS BEEN MAINLY ASSESSED FROM THE ENERGETIC PERSPECTIVE, STRESSING HOUSEHOLD RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE EFFECT GASES AND CLIMATE CHANGE. FEW STUDIES DEAL WITH OTHER EMISSIONS AND WASTES. THERE IS A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, TOO. ENVIRONMENTAL INPUT-OUTPUT (I-O) ANALYSIS AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT ARE THE METHODS USUALLY EMPLOYED, TOGETHER WITH THE USE OF ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND EXPENDITURE INFORMATION. INFORMATION ABOUT DIRECT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS IS COMPLEMENTED WITH DATA ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES. MULTIREGIONAL I-O TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED TO CAPTURE UPSTREAM REQUIREMENTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID ERRORS OWING TO TRUNCATION AND DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY ASSUMPTIONS. HOUSING, FOOD, AND MOBILITY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSUMPTION CATEGORIES, BUT THE SHARES OF THESE CATEGORIES IN THE REQUIREMENTS ARE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIOECONOMIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. FINALLY, CHALLENGES FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED BASED ON THE NEED FOR NEW METHODOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL OF THE METABOLIC NARRATIVE TO ELABORATE INFORMATION RELEVANT TO SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION POLICIES.",""

REUSE, RECYCLING AND ENERGY RECOVERY ARE EXISTING ACTIVITIES IN EVERY SOCIETY BUT THEY ARE POORLY REFLECTED IN OFFICIAL STATISTICS. REACHING HIGHER LEVELS OF REUSE, RECYCLING AND ENERGY RECOVERY MAY PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES (I.E., IN TERMS OF GDP, JOBS, REDUCED IMPACTS), BUT NOT ALL OPTIONS WILL HAVE A NET WIN-WIN-WIN PROPERTY IN PRACTICE, AS THEY REDUCE THE NEED FOR PRODUCING NEW COMMODITIES. IN OPEN ECONOMIES, MANY PRIMARY RESOURCES, COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTED FROM ABROAD, AND MANY GOODS PRODUCED ARE EXPORTED ABROAD. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES A TOP-DOWN METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING THE SUBSTITUTION POTENTIAL OF INTENSIFYING SPECIFIC SMM-STRATEGIES AND MATERIAL EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES. WE COMBINED BOTH REGIONAL AND MULTI-REGIONAL EE-IO (ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT) MODELS TO LINK INDUSTRIAL SECTORS TO SMM-STRATEGIES. OUR METHOD ENABLES US TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENT SMM AND MATERIAL EFFICIENCY STRATEGIES IN TERMS OF THE MAXIMUM AVAILABLE BUDGETS FOR REACHING THEM ON A BREAK EVEN BASIS, MAXIMUM SAVINGS IN GLOBAL WARMING EMISSIONS AND SUBSTITUTED EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS, BOTH THROUGH A REGIONAL AND GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE. WE ADD A CASE ON FLANDERS (NORTHERN REGION IN BELGIUM) TO ILLUSTRATE THE METHODOLOGY. FLANDERS IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A POLICY FOR SMM. SELECTING NEW REGIONAL ACTIONS FOR A SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS MANAGEMENT POLICY CAN BENEFIT FROM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERNATIONAL ENTANGLED VALUE CHAINS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF THE CHAIN IS WITHIN REACH OF DOMESTIC POLICIES AND ALSO TO ASSESS THE CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL WINNERS AND LOSERS, REGARDING GDP, JOBS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD. WE ILLUSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES FOR FLANDERS FROM FOUR GENERIC SMM-STRATEGIES: ENERGY RECOVERY, FOOD WASTE PREVENTION, RECYCLING AND REUSE. FROM A STRICT REGIONAL SELF-INTEREST PERSPECTIVE, IT IS PREFERABLE TO SUBSTITUTE FOREIGN VALUE CHAINS WITH LOCAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. REUSE CREATES BY FAR THE LARGEST BUDGET FOR NEW ACTIVITIES TO REALIZE THE STRATEGY (31.2\% OF FLEMISH GDP COMPARED TO 8.3\% FOR FOOD WASTE PREVENTION, 6.2\% FOR ENERGY RECOVERY AND 4.2\% FOR RECYCLING). ALL FOUR STRATEGIES HAVE SIMILAR AND SIGNIFICANT POTENTIALS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, FOOD WASTE PREVENTION AND REUSE HAVE HIGHER POTENTIALS TO REDUCE FLEMISH TERRITORIAL GHG-EMISSIONS. FROM A PURE FLEMISH EMPLOYMENT PERSPECTIVE, THE ENERGY RECOVERY AND RECYCLING STRATEGIES COULD REPLACE THE FEWEST FLEMISH JOBS, AND FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE, ALL STRATEGIES MOST LIKELY IMPLY LOSSES OF JOBS ABROAD.

WITHIN A GIVEN COUNTRY, IT WOULD HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT IN MANY AREAS, IN PARTICULAR ON GOVERNMENTS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO QUANTIFY THE RESPECTIVE IMPACTS ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES OF AN ELECTRICALLY POWERED OR PETROL FUELLED PRIVATE CAR. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, WE ESTABLISH AN INTEGRATED METHOD OF VALUATION, COVERING BOTH MANUFACTURE AND USE OF THE VEHICLE, WITH LOCATION OF THESE TWO STAGES WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY CONCERNED. FROM A ``DEPTH'' PERSPECTIVE, IT INCORPORATES THE ECONOMIC PROCEEDS FROM THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND WHAT THEY CONSUME, AND FROM A ``BREADTH'' PERSPECTIVE IT INCORPORATES THE FISCAL EFFECTS (VAT, FUEL AND ENERGY TAXES, TAX ON PRODUCTION, ETC.) AND THE EFFECTS ON SOCIAL ACCOUNTS (SOCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS, UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS). THE VALUATION METHOD IS BASED ON AN INPUT OUTPUT MODEL OF THE PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY WITHIN A COUNTRY, COMBINED WITH MECHANISMS OF FISCAL AND SOCIAL TRANSFER. WE HYPOTHESIZE AN ADDITIONAL TYPE OF ACTIVITY FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AND WE MODEL IT WITHIN THE INTERSECTORIAL MATRIX ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION. APPLICATION OF THE METHOD TO FRANCE REVEALS FIRST THAT THE IMPACT OF A VEHICLE ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES IS SUBSTANTIAL: MANUFACTURE CONTRIBUTES APPROXIMATELY THE PURCHASE PRICE EXCLUDING VAT, AND USAGE ADDS AN AMOUNT OF THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE REVENUES (APPROXIMATELY 70\%) ARISE FROM THE SOCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY VALUE OF EMPLOYMENT; VAT ACCOUNTS FOR ALMOST 20\%, TAX ON PRODUCTION AROUND 5\%, AND ENERGY TAXES 9\% FOR A CV VEHICLE OR 1\% FOR AN EV. THEN, FOUR CASES FOR SUBSTITUTION OF EV TO CV ARE SET UP AND ASSESSED, DEPENDING ON THE PLACES EITHER DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN IN WHICH THE VEHICLE IS MANUFACTURED AND USED, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE BASE CASE, WHERE THE VEHICLE IS BOTH MANUFACTURED AND USED INSIDE THE COUNTRY, SUBSTITUTING AN EV TO A CV WOULD BE FINANCIALLY NEUTRAL FOR PUBLIC FINANCES AT LEAST BEFORE ANY PURCHASE INCENTIVE BONUS. THE EXPORT CASE, WHERE AN EV IS SUBSTITUTED TO A CV IN DOMESTIC PRODUCTION BUT THEN EXPORTED AND HENCE USED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, YIELDS AN ADDITIONAL REVENUE OF ABOUT 8000 TO THE DOMESTIC PUBLIC FINANCES (WITHOUT BONUS); THE IMPORT CASE HAS AN OPPOSITE EFFECT. LASTLY, THE TWOFOLD SUBSTITUTION OF AN IMPORTED EV TO A DOMESTICALLY MANUFACTURED CV FOR DOMESTIC USE WOULD ENTAIL A LOSS OF ABOUT 20,000 (WITHOUT BONUS).

EFFECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES, COMMODITIES OR CAPITAL UNDER CRISIS CONDITIONS TO MINIMIZE THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. IN SUCH CASES, IT IS NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT RATIONAL DISTRIBUTION POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED. INPUT OUTPUT MODELS ARE USED TO ILLUSTRATE INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG ECONOMIC SECTORS AND TO ASSESS BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF DISRUPTIVE EVENTS. ALTERNATIVELY, THESE INTERDEPENDENCIES MAY BE EXPLOITED FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE RECOVERY EFFORTS TO MINIMIZE THE RIPPLE EFFECTS OF A CRISIS. IN THIS PAPER, A PROCESS GRAPH REPRESENTATION OF THE INPUT OUTPUT MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO GENERATE A RATIONAL PROCEDURE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES, COMMODITIES OR CAPITAL DURING CRISIS CONDITIONS. THE PROCESS GRAPH MODEL IS A GRAPH-THEORETIC APPROACH ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED FOR CHEMICAL PROCESS DESIGN APPLICATIONS. THE ANALOGOUS PROBLEM STRUCTURE ALLOWS IT TO BE USED FOR THE INPUT-OUTPUT SYSTEM. THE METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH SEVERAL CASE STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ALLOCATION POLICIES GEARED TOWARDS REDUCING THE IMPACT OF DISRUPTIONS ATTRIBUTED TO CRITICAL RESOURCES, COMMODITIES, OR CAPITAL. RESULTS SHOW THAT DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES, COMMODITIES OR CAPITAL WILL SATISFY THE FINAL DEMANDS OF SOME ECONOMIC SECTORS AND REDUCE THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OTHERS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE REDUCTION OF TOTAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.

IMPROVING ECO-EFFICIENCY IS WIDELY ACCEPTED NOT ONLY AS A MEANS OF INCREASING ECONOMIC VALUE, BUT ALSO AS A MEANS OF REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. HOWEVER, MANAGING FOR ECO-EFFICIENCY SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE DIFFERENCES AMONG INDUSTRIES, BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF ECO-EFFICIENCY ON FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE VARIES AMONG INDUSTRIES. TO EXPLORE THIS VARIATION, WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-INDUSTRY ANALYSIS OF ECO-EFFICIENCY BASED ON SOCIAL PERFORMANCE USING DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA). DEA MEASURES RELATIVE EFFICIENCY AND IS A USEFUL TOOL FOR TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS. USING DEA, ECO-EFFICIENCY SCORES WERE DERIVED BASED ON THE RATIO OF TWO FACTORS OF SOCIAL PERFORMANCE: (1) VALUE-ADDED INDUCING AND PRODUCTION-INDUCING ECONOMIC SPILLOVER EFFECTS AND (2) THE AMOUNT OF GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED AND ENERGY USED. THEN, WE IDENTIFIED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR ECO-EFFICIENCY SCORE AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS A MEASURE OF THE FIRM'S STABILITY. THE CASE STUDY IS BASED ON 272 FIRMS IN 16 INDUSTRIES IN SOUTH KOREA. RESULTS SHOW THAT FIRMS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ECO-EFFICIENCY SCORES THAN THOSE IN RAW MATERIAL OR CHEMICAL-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES. IN ADDITION, MOST OF THE INDUSTRIES REVEAL NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE METRICS AND ECO-EFFICIENCY SCORES. A HANDFUL OF INDUSTRIES HAD SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE METRICS; IN SOME CASES, THESE RELATIONSHIPS WERE NEGATIVE, WHEREAS IN OTHERS THEY WERE POSITIVE. SURPRISINGLY, ALMOST ALL INDUSTRIES HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ECO-EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS RESULT IMPLIES THAT GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR POLICIES THAT REWARD FIRMS THAT ATTEMPT TO BE ECO-EFFICIENT ARE NEEDED, OR THAT OTHER NONFINANCIAL METRICS THAT INFLUENCE ECO-EFFICIENCY, SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT AND BRAND REPUTATION, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

ON THE OTHER HAND, CHINA IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST EXPORTER PRODUCING GOODS FOR THE CONSUMPTION IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF ECOLOGICALLY UNEQUAL EXCHANGE THAT LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES EXPORT NATURAL RESOURCES AND HIGH IMPACT COMMODITIES THUS ALLOWING RICHER COUNTRIES TO REDUCE ECOLOGICALLY HARMFUL INDUSTRIES DOMESTICALLY, WE ASSESS THE UNEQUAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN CHINA AND THE REST OF WORLD (186 COUNTRIES) USING VALUE ADDED, AND FOUR ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS: SO2 EMISSIONS, GHG EMISSIONS, WATER, AND LAND, ASSOCIATED WITH CHINA'S TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. BY USING A GLOBAL MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL, WE FOUND THAT DEVELOPED REGIONS, SUCH AS NORTH AMERICA, THE EU AND EAST ASIA INCLUDING JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA EXTERNALIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THROUGH IMPORTING GOODS PRODUCED IN CHINA.

THE EU'S POLICY TARGETS ARE USED AS A PLANETARY BOUNDARY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. THE 2020 TARGET IS SHOWN TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE BULGARIAN-STYLE CONSUMPTION, WITH ROOM FOR A MUCH HIGHER GDP. THE 2050 TARGET, HOWEVER, IS TOO NARROW, AND A SLIGHTLY SMALLER CONSUMPTION PATTERN IS NEEDED TO REACH THE TARGET. ALTHOUGH THE APPROACH IS HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED AND NEGLECTS MANY DEVELOPMENTS, THE IDEA OF USING IO-TABLES AND MINIMUM CONSUMPTION LEVELS TO BACKCAST DIRECTIONS TO BE TAKEN IS EXPECTED TO HELP POLICYMAKERS. WE ACKNOWLEDGE SOME IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF OUR APPROACH, BUT ACCEPT THESE IN THE CONTEXT OF EXPLORING FUTURE SCENARIOS AND HOW TO GET THERE, INSTEAD OF PREDICTING THE FUTURE.",""

DIETARY PATTERNS IN PARTICULAR, EMBEDDED IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF FOODS AND OTHER BIOMASS BASED COMMODITIES, DETERMINE THE DIMENSION OF BENEFICIAL OR HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR - BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD. IN THIS STUDY WE ANALYSED DIFFERENT DIETARY SCENARIOS FROM A VIRTUAL LAND FLOW PERSPECTIVE, BASED ON REPRESENTATIVE CONSUMPTION DATA FOR GERMANY IN THE YEARS 2006 AND 1985-89. FURTHER WE IDENTIFIED THE CONSUMER GROUPS THAT WOULD HAVE TO ADAPT MOST TO BALANCE GERMANY'S VIRTUAL LAND IMPORT AND ANALYSED THE IMPACT REDUCED FOOD WASTAGE. FOR THE STUDY, OFFICIAL DATA SETS CONCERNING PRODUCTION, TRADE AND CONSUMPTION WERE USED. WE DERIVED LAND USE DATA FROM ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT DATA SETS AND FAO STATISTICS. THE CONVERSION OF AGRICULTURAL RAW PRODUCTS TO CONSUMED COMMODITIES IS BASED ON OFFICIAL PROCESSING AND COMPOSITION DATA. SUBGROUP-SPECIFIC INTAKE DATA FROM THE LAST REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL NUTRITION SURVEY IN GERMANY WERE USED. WE ANALYSED 42 COMMODITIES, AGGREGATED INTO 23 PRODUCT GROUPS, SEVEN LAND USE TYPES AND SIX NUTRITION SCENARIOS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT IN THE BASELINE SCENARIO THE AVERAGE NUTRITION IN THE YEAR 2006 LEADS TO A VIRTUAL LAND IMPORT OF 707 M(2) P(-1) A(-1) WHICH REPRESENTS 30\% OF THE TOTAL NUTRITION-INDUCED LAND DEMAND OF 2365 M(2) P(-1) ON THE OTHER HAND, THE GERMAN AGRI-FOOD SECTOR EXPORTS VIRTUAL LAND, IN THE FORM OF COMMODITIES, EQUIVALENT TO 262 M(2) P(-1) A(-1). IN THIS PAPER WE CALCULATE THAT THE RESULTING NET IMPORT OF VIRTUAL LAND COULD BE BALANCED BY WAY OF A SHIFT TO AN OFFICIALLY RECOMMENDED DIET AND A REDUCTION IN THE CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS (COCOA, COFFEE, GREEN/BLACK TEA, WINE). A SHIFT TO AN OVO-LACTO-VEGETARIAN OR VEGAN DIET WOULD EVEN LEAD TO A POSITIVE VIRTUAL LAND BALANCE (EVEN WITH MAINTAINED CONSUMPTION OF STIMULANTS). MOREOVER, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT A SHIFT IN THE AVERAGE DIET PROFILE COULD LEAD TO MAINTAINED OR EVEN EXPANDED EXPORT COMPETITIVENESS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENABLE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. SINCE SUCH A DIET SHIFT COMPLIES WITH OFFICIAL DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS, IT FOLLOWS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS MAY WELL RESULT. WE SHOW FURTHER THAT A REDUCTION OF AVOIDABLE FOOD LOSSES/WASTAGE WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO LEVEL OUT THE VIRTUAL LAND BALANCE OF THE AVERAGE NUTRITION IN GERMANY. REGARDING THE DIETARY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LAST 20 YEARS, WE ARGUE THAT A DIETARY SHIFT RESULTING IN A ZERO LAND BALANCE IS WITHIN REACH. THE POPULATION GROUPS THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED MOST ARE YOUNGER AND MIDDLE-AGED MEN. NEVERTHELESS, WOMEN'S LAND SAVING POTENTIALS SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED NEITHER.

SPECIFICALLY, OUR MODIFICATION ENABLES A BETTER MEANS OF ``SUBTRACTING OUT'' THE POLLUTANT EMISSIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTED INTERMEDIATE INPUTS (BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL IN CHINA). WE FIND, NEVERTHELESS, THAT LARGE PROPORTIONS OF EMISSIONS OF HEAVY METALS (CR6+ AND PB) CONTAINED IN WASTEWATER CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO EXPORTS. IN 2007, THESE FIGURES REACHED MORE THAN 40\% OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TOTAL EMISSIONS. TOTAL QUANTITIES OF EXPORT-EMBODIED WASTEWATER, SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) AND SOLID WASTE HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY FROM 1997 TO 2007. THE RELATIVE RATES OF GROWTH IN THE PERCENTAGES OF EXPORT-EMBODIED POLLUTANTS IN TOTAL INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS, HOWEVER, WERE LOWER THAN THE RELATIVE RATE OF GROWTH IN THE PERCENTAGE OF EXPORTS IN CHINA'S TOTAL GDP OVER THIS SAME DECADE. THREE CLUSTERS OF SECTORS PLAY DOMINANT ROLES IN DRIVING CHINA'S EXPORT EMBODIED EMISSIONS: TEXTILES, LEATHER AND CLOTHING APPAREL; ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT; AND THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY. WE SUGGEST THAT PROMOTING THE TRANSITION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF EXPORT PRODUCTS TOWARD HIGH VALUE-ADDED AND LOW EMBODIED-EMISSION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (THEMSELVES ENHANCED BY CLEANER PRODUCTION METHODS) SHOULD BE REGARDED AS A LONG-TERM GOAL OF CHINA'S TRADE POLICY.

ALTHOUGH QUANTIFYING AND ANALYZING THE SUSTAINABILITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED SUFFICIENTLY. THEREFORE, THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUANTIFY THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS USING AN ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT-BASED SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK. IN THIS RESEARCH, THE COMMODITY-BY-INDUSTRY SUPPLY AND USE TABLES PUBLISHED BY THE U.S. BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, ARE MERGED WITH A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL METRICS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AFTER DETERMINING THESE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT METRICS, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF U.S CONSTRUCTION SECTORS HAVE BEEN ANALYZED FROM A TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE PERSPECTIVE. WHEN ANALYZING THE TOTAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS BY EACH CONSTRUCTION SECTOR, ``RESIDENTIAL PERMANENT SINGLE AND MULTI-FAMILY STRUCTURES'' AND ``OTHER NON-RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES'' ARE FOUND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER CONSTRUCTION SECTORS. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT INDIRECT SUPPLIERS OF CONSTRUCTION SECTORS HAVE THE LARGEST SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS COMPARED WITH ON-SITE ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR ALL U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS, ON-SITE CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES ARE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LESS THAN 5 \% OF TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION, WHEREAS ABOUT 95 \% OF TOTAL WATER USE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO INDIRECT SUPPLIERS. IN ADDITION, SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGHEST CARBON EMISSIONS COMPARED WITH SCOPES 1 AND 2. THEREFORE, USING NARROWLY DEFINED SYSTEM BOUNDARIES BY IGNORING SUPPLY CHAIN-RELATED IMPACTS CAN RESULT IN UNDERESTIMATION OF TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) STUDIES THAT CONSIDER ALL DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES ARE STILL LIMITED, AND THE CURRENT RESEARCH IS AN IMPORTANT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE THE TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS IN A HOLISTIC WAY.

THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT COUNTRIES WITH AN OPEN ECONOMY ARE ACTIVE PLAYERS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE. TRADE IS NOT ONLY A MAJOR FACTOR IN FORGING A COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, BUT CONTRIBUTES TO THE MOVEMENT OF EMBODIED EMISSIONS BEYOND COUNTRY BORDERS. THIS ISSUE IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT FROM THE CARBON ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DOMESTIC PRODUCTION PERSPECTIVE, AS IT IS KNOWN THAT THE PRODUCTION-BASED PRINCIPLE IS EMPLOYED IN THE KYOTO AGREEMENT. THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED HEREIN WAS DESIGNED TO REVEAL THE INTERDEPENDENCE OF COUNTRIES ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THE CORRESPONDING EMBODIED EMISSIONS BOTH ON NATIONAL AND ON SECTORAL LEVEL AND TO ILLUSTRATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSION ACCOUNTING. IT IS PRESENTED HERE TO WHAT EXTENT A CONSUMPTION-BASED ACCOUNTING WOULD CHANGE THE PRESENT SYSTEM BASED ON PRODUCTION-BASED ACCOUNTING AND ALLOCATION. THE RELATIONSHIP OF CO2 EMISSION EMBODIED IN EXPORTS AND EMBODIED IN IMPORTS IS ANALYSED HERE. INTERNATIONAL TRADE CAN BLUR THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION AND IT CAN LENGTHEN THE LINK BETWEEN CONSUMPTION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES. INPUT OUTPUT MODELS ARE USED IN THE METHODOLOGY AS THEY PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE FRAMEWORK FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ACCOUNTING. THE ANALYSIS COMPRISES AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FOUR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE NETHERLANDS, AND HUNGARY) WITH EXTENDED TRADING ACTIVITIES AND CARBON EMISSIONS. MOVING FROM A PRODUCTION-BASED APPROACH IN CLIMATE POLICY TO A CONSUMPTION-BASED PRINCIPLE AND ALLOCATION APPROACH WOULD HELP TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND WOULD FORCE COUNTRIES TO RETHINK THEIR TRADING ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO DECREASE THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOAD OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TWO EMISSION ACCOUNTING APPROACHES, BOTH ON THE GLOBAL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER LTD.

UNDER THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, LIAONING PROVINCE, A TYPICAL HEAVY INDUSTRIAL PROVINCE IN NORTH CHINA IS CHOSEN AS A CASE STUDY REGION. THE INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS METHOD IS EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE WATER FOOTPRINT BOTH FROM PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE TOTAL WATER FOOTPRINT OF LIAONING IN 2007 WAS 7.30 BILLION M(3), A 84.6\% OF INTERNAL WATER FOOTPRINT AND A 15.4\% EXTERNAL WATER FOOTPRINT. THE WATER TRADE BALANCE OF LIAONING WAS 2.68 BILLION M(3), INDICATING THAT LIAONING WAS A NET WATER EXPORT REGION, ALTHOUGH WATER SHORTAGES ARE BECOMING A MORE SERIOUS CONCERN. THE ``AGRICULTURE'' AND ``FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCTION'' SECTORS ARE FOUND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST WATER FOOTPRINT, WATER INTENSITY, WATER EXPORTS, AND WATER TRADE BALANCE.

STANDARD LCA USUALLY DOES NOT ADDRESS THESE LOSSES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO QUANTIFYING QUALITY- AND DILUTION LOSSES, BY MEANS OF HYBRID INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. WE FOCUS ON THE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECYCLING OF FERROUS MATERIALS FROM END-OF-LIFE VEHICLE (ELV) DUE TO THE MIXING OF COPPER, A TYPICAL CONTAMINANT IN STEEL RECYCLING. GIVEN THE QUALITY OF SCRAP IN TERMS OF COPPER DENSITY, THE MODEL DETERMINES THE RATIO BY WHICH SCRAP NEEDS TO BE DILUTED IN AN ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE (EAF), AND THE AMOUNT OF DEMAND FOR EAF STEEL INCLUDING THOSE QUANTITIES NEEDED FOR DILUTION. APPLICATION TO A HIGH-RESOLUTION JAPANESE IO TABLE SUPPLEMENTED WITH DATA ON FERROUS MATERIALS INCLUDING DIFFERENT GRADES OF SCRAP INDICATES THAT A NATIONWIDE AVOIDANCE OF THESE LOSSES COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF CO2 EMISSIONS.",""

THE ESSENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF SERVICES, AND ESPECIALLY OF SOME OF THEIR ACTIVITIES, CONSISTS OF POSITIVE IMPACT THEY PRODUCE ON USER ACTIVITIES. IN THIS WORK THE TERTIARISATION OF PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN UNION (EU) NEW AND OLD MEMBER STATES, EMPLOYING THE INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES, IS ANALYZED. TO BE PRECISE, THE TERTIARISATION EFFECTS OBTAINED USING TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS AND LEONTIEF INVERSE MATRIX COEFFICIENTS ARE THOROUGHLY EXAMINED. OUR ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE DIRECT AND TOTAL EFFECTS. DIRECT EFFECTS COMPRISE THE IMMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE DEMAND OF EACH PRODUCTIVE SECTOR NECESSARY TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL UNIT OF ITS PRODUCT. ON THE OTHER HAND, TOTAL EFFECTS MEASURE ALL THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUTS NEEDED TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL UNIT OF OUTPUT. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SELECTED COUNTRIES REFERS TO THEIR REDUCED SIZE THAT CAN BE COMPARED TO THE NUTS 2 REGIONS. THE EU, ESTABLISHING ITS REGIONAL POLICY, WHICH MAIN GOAL CONSISTS IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND TERRITORIAL COHESION, TAKES INTO ACCOUNT REGIONS PRECISELY OF THIS LEVEL. SO, THIS ANALYSIS ENABLES NOT ONLY TO COMPARE THE STATE OF TERTIARISATION IN THE NEW AND OLD EUROPEAN MEMBER COUNTRIES, BUT ALSO TO APPROACH THIS ANALYSIS TO THE TERRITORY LEVEL SIMILAR TO NUTS 2 REGIONS. THE STUDY CARRIED OUT IN THIS WORK, ENABLES US, ON THE ONE HAND, TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCES EXISTING BETWEEN COUNTRIES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE SHARE OF THE TERTIARY SECTOR IN TOTAL GROSS VALUE ADDED (GVA) AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE USE OF SERVICES BY WHOLE OF THE PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS.

THESE TRENDS ARE DUE TO A REDUCTION IN TOTAL CO2 EMISSION INTENSITY, A DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE, AND SMALL IMPORTS OF EMBODIED CO(2)EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE SDA DEMONSTRATE THAT TOTAL EXPORT VOLUME WAS THE LARGEST DRIVING FACTOR FOR THE INCREASE IN EMBODIED CO2 EMISSIONS DURING 2002-2007, FOLLOWED BY INTERMEDIATE INPUT STRUCTURE. DIRECT CO(2)EMISSIONS INTENSITY HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON CHANGES IN EMBODIED CO2 EMISSIONS.

IN THE PERIOD OF 2002-2012, THE PRODUCTION-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS OF CHONGMING INCREASED FROM 0.96 MT TONS TO 2.05 MT TONS, WITH A LOWER GROWTH RATE THAN THE NATIONAL LEVEL. DUE TO THE DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING RESEARCH DATA, THE EXISTING RESEARCH HAS NOT USED THE INPUT-OUTPUT METHOD TO EVALUATE THE CO2 EMISSIONS OF CHONGMING. THIS PAPER CALCULATES THE CONSUMPTION-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS IN CHONGMING BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012 BASED ON AN OPTIMIZATION METHOD OF MATRIX UPDATING AND AN ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUTOUTPUT MODEL. STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS (SDA) IS ALSO USED TO STUDY THE DRIVING FORCES OF CONSUMPTION-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS DURING THIS PERIOD. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FROM 2002 TO 2012, THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF CHONGMING'S CONSUMPTION-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS WAS 12.74\%. IN 2002, CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS WERE MAINLY CAUSED BY GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, AND IN 2007 AND 2012, CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS WERE MAINLY CAUSED BY DOMESTIC OUTFLOW. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN THE FINAL DEMAND VOLUME AND FINAL DEMAND STRUCTURE WERE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE RAPID GROWTH IN CHONGMING'S CONSUMPTION-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS.

THE EXIOBASE V3.3 HYBRID DATABASE IS USED TO PERFORM THE ASSESSMENT, SHOWING THAT THE METAL SECTOR REPRESENTS 13\% OF THE TOTAL FRENCH CARBON FOOTPRINT. THIS CONTRIBUTION IS MAINLY DUE TO THE ``IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION'' ACTIVITIES THAT ARE LINKED TO THE ``CONSTRUCTION'' AND ``MOTOR VEHICLES, TRAILERS AND SEMI-TRAILERS'' GOODS CONSUMED IN FRANCE. THE ASSESSMENT ALSO SHOWS THAT FRANCE OUTSOURCES 79\% OF THE METAL SECTOR GHG EMISSIONS INDUCED BY ITS CONSUMPTION. 55\% OF THESE EMISSIONS OCCUR IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND MORE THAN 17\% SPECIFICALLY IN CHINA. THEREFORE, DESPITE METALLIC ORES ARE PRATICALLY NOT ANYMORE MINED IN FRANCE, THE EMBODIED METAL ON THE FRENCH FINAL DEMAND INDIRECTLY GENERATES LARGE GREENHOUSE GASES EMISSIONS ABROAD (IN PARTICULAR CO2).

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA'S WATER USE HAS INCREASED BY 58 BILLION M(3) DURING 2002-2012, AND THEN DECREASED BY 13 BILLION M(3) DURING 2012-2017. WATER USE EFFICIENCY GAINS AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS EFFECTIVELY OFFSET THE INCREASE IN WATER USE, WHICH IS DRIVEN BY THE RISING FINAL DEMAND LEVEL AND GROWING POPULATION. SLIGHT CHANGES IN INTER-SECTORAL TRANSACTIONS OF WATER INTENSIVE SECTORS WOULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES ON THE EFFECTS OF PRODUCTION STRUCTURE CHANGES ON WATER USE CHANGES. THUS, CLOSE ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE CHANGES IN PRODUCTION STRUCTURES OF THESE SECTORS. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF THE URBANIZATION PROCESS ARE MAINLY REFLECTED BY THE GROWING GAPS BETWEEN WATER USES CAUSED BY RURAL AND URBAN HOUSEHOLDS, AS WELL AS INCREASED URBANIZATION-RELATED WATER USE. THIS IS NOTABLY DRIVEN BY INTENSIVE INVESTMENTS IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. WATER CONSERVATION POLICIES IN CHINA SHOULD SPECIALLY FOCUS ON THE OPTIMIZATION OF PRODUCTION STRUCTURE, SUCH AS IMPROVING THE PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY OF SECTORS WITH LARGE CONSUMPTION-BASED WATER USE.",""

STATIC ASSESSMENTS AND SIMULATIONS OF THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS AMONG PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION ARE IMPORTANT FOR DETERMINING THE MECHANISM BEHIND THE NEXUS; HOWEVER, DYNAMIC STUDIES CAN HELP DETERMINE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS FOR SHAPING ENERGY AND WATER SYNERGETIC MANAGEMENT. THUS, WE PROBED THE DRIVING FACTORS OF THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS IN CHINA THROUGH STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS FROM 1990 TO 2014 AND DECOMPOSED THE WATER CONSUMPTION OF DIFFERENT CONSUMERS INTO SIX ENERGY RELATED FACTORS: THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS COEFFICIENT, THE ENERGY INTENSITY, THE PRODUCTION STRUCTURE, THE CONSUMPTION VOLUME PER CAPITA OF FINAL CONSUMERS, CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, AND THE POPULATION. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CONSUMPTION VOLUME, WHICH INDICATES THE CONSUMPTION LEVELS OF DIFFERENT CONSUMERS, CONTRIBUTED 156\% OF THE INCREASE OF THE TOTAL ENERGY RELATED WATER CONSUMPTION IN 2014 COMPARED WITH THAT IN 1990. ADDITIONALLY, THE ENERGY INTENSITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVING FACTOR THAT CAN REDUCE THE TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION OF ALL CONSUMERS (HOUSEHOLD, GOVERNMENT, GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMAT, ETC.), ACCOUNTING FOR -271\% OF THE WATER CONSUMPTION IN 2014. THE CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, I.E., EXPENDITURES ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS IN DIFFERENT SECTORS, ALSO SHOW POSITIVE IMPACTS ON WATER CONSUMPTION CONSERVATION FOR THE GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMAT AND GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH THEY CAN AGGRAVATE THE WATER CONSUMPTION IN HOUSEHOLDS. THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DRIVING FORCES FOR DIFFERENT CONSUMERS ALSO SHOWS THAT PROSPERITY IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND OTHER RELATED INDUSTRIES HAS INDIRECTLY DRIVEN MORE WATER FLOW INTO GROSS FIXED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND THE GOVERNMENT, WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE SUSTAINABLE WATER CONSUMPTION GOAL IN CHINA.",""
