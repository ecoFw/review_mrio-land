IN THIS PAPER, COMBINING A RANGE OF MODELING METHODOLOGIES IS PROPOSED AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER. THE CHOICE OF MODELS TO BE USED WOULD DEPEND ON THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM AND REGION BEING STUDIED. ONE POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF MODELS IS DISCUSSES IN THIS PAPER FOR THE SPECIFIC CASE OF INDIA. THE INTEGRATED MODELING FRAMEWORK (IMF) PROPOSED COMBINES THREE MODELING APPROACHES - I) INDEX DECOMPOSITION TO ESTIMATE IMPACTS OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, II) CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION TO ESTIMATE LEAST COST FUEL OPTIONS FOR THE POWER SECTOR, III) INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. THE MODEL RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MODE OF INVESTMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF THE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCOMES, AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION IN INDIA. IN SOME SCENARIOS, HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN GREEN ENERGY NEGATIVELY AFFECTS LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AS COMPARED TO OTHER HOUSEHOLDS. THE PAPER ALSO DEMONSTRATES HOW THE IMF CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONS FOR AND THEREFORE ALLEVIATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

WE USE THE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF FOUR SOLAR ENERGY POLICY INTERVENTIONS ON PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) INVESTMENTS, GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE, ECONOMIC OUTPUTS, CO2E EMISSIONS AND THE USES OF STEEL, ALUMINIUM, CONCRETE AND ENERGY. THE RESULTS OF OUR ANALYSIS CALL FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE PV DONOR GIFT POLICY, THE IMPROVEMENT OF PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN THE PV INDUSTRY AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AFTER-SALES SERVICES AND RURAL FINANCING INSTITUTIONS. A 100 W PEAK (WP) PV UNDER THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE AFFORDABLE FOR 80.6\% OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO BE WITHOUT ACCESS TO ELECTRICITY IN 2029. NET METERING IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICY FOR ENCOURAGING URBAN PEOPLE TO INVEST IN PV IN A SITUATION WHERE FOSSIL ENERGY PRICES ARE INCREASING AND PV PRICES ARE DECLINING. A DONOR GIFT POLICY MAY INDUCE USD 51.9 NEW ECONOMIC OUTPUTS FOR EVERY WP OF PV OPERATING TO CAPACITY IN 2029, BUT WOULD REQUIRE A SUBSIDY OF USD 18.6/WP. THE RECOMMENDED POLICIES DO NOT REQUIRE SUBSIDIES AND REDUCE CO2EQ EMISSIONS AND THE CONSUMPTION OF ALUMINIUM, ENERGY, STEEL AND CONCRETE BY BETWEEN 83.1\% AND 89.7\% MORE THAN THE EXISTING POLICY. SEVERAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN RESPONSE TO THESE FINDINGS.

INCREASES IN SUCH EVENTS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE DELTAS, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ECOSYSTEMS AND, ULTIMATELY, INTO IMPACTS ON LIVELIHOODS AND HUMAN WELL-BEING. ACCORDINGLY, CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY THE BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF DELTAIC ENVIRONMENTS BUT ALSO THEIR ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHERMORE, THESE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS WILL SPILL OVER TO OTHER REGIONS THROUGH GOODS AND SERVICES SUPPLY CHAINS AND VIA MIGRATION. IN THIS PAPER WE TAKE A WIDER VIEW ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC STUDIES WITHIN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. WE ANALYSE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BIOPHYSICAL CONTEXT OF THE DELTAS CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, IN THE DELTAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE CONSTRUCT A SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL-EXTENDED MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASES AND SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRICES THAT ARE USED TO TRACE THE FLOW OF PROVISIONING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAINS, PROVIDING A VIEW OF THE LINKS BETWEEN THE BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO INTEGRATE THIS INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL TO ASSESS HOW THE CHANGES IN THE PROVISION OF NATURAL RESOURCES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE CAN POTENTIALLY AFFECT THE ECONOMIES OF THE DELTAS AND LINKED REGIONS, AND HOW THIS IN TURN AFFECTS ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THESE REGIONS.

TO COMPREHENSIVELY REVEAL THIS PROBLEM, A NEW CONSUMPTION-BASED SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) EMISSION INVENTORY IN 2010 FOR 30 PROVINCIAL REGIONS OF CHINA WAS COMPILED BY INTRODUCING SOURCE RECEPTOR RELATIONSHIP (SRR) MODEL TO INTEGRATE THE SPILLOVER IMPACTS OF PHYSICAL TRANSPORT FROM THE EMITTER (PRODUCER) REGION TO THE RECEPTOR REGION AND VIRTUAL TRANSFER FROM THE DRIVER (CONSUMER) REGION TO THE EMITTER REGION. COMPARED THE EMISSIONS INDUCED BY FINAL REGIONAL DEMAND WITH THE EMISSIONS RECEIVED IN SEVEN REGIONS OF CHINA, SOUTHERN (0.59 MT), NORTHERN (0.25 MT), NORTHWESTERN (0.18 MT), AND EASTERN (0.14 MT) AREAS OUTSOURCED SO2 POLLUTION IN THE MASS, WHEREAS CENTRAL (-0.66 MT), NORTHEASTERN (-0.42 MT), AND SOUTHWESTERN (-0.08 MT) AREAS TOOK EXCESSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS IN 2010. THE FOUR MUNICIPALITIES, CHONGQING, SHANGHAI, BEIJING, AND TIANJIN AS WELL AS THE MOST AFFLUENT PROVINCE GUANG-DONG SHOWED SIGNIFICANT POLLUTION TRANSFER AFTER AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ROLES IN DRIVERS, EMITTERS AND RECEPTORS. SHANXI, INNER MONGOLIA, GUIZHOU, HENAN, AND SHANDONG SHOWED THE LARGEST CO-BENEFITS OF SO2 EMISSIONS CONTROL FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION. JAPAN WAS FOUND TO RECEIVE MORE PORTIONS OF TRANSBOUNDARY SO2 DEPOSITION THAN ITS MARKET SHARES IN CHINA'S EXPORT INSTEAD OF OTHER MAJOR TRADE PARTNERS OF CHINA. AS A MEGA-CITY, BEIJING INDUCED SIGNIFICANT SO2 EMISSIONS FOR POWER REQUIREMENT, FOOD CONSUMPTION, MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES, AND HER VIBRANT RESEARCH ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE SECTORS OF THE POWER INDUSTRY, COAL MINING, CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, FOOD-RELATED INDUSTRIES, PETROLEUM PROCESSING AND COKING, BUT 86\% OF THOSE EMISSIONS WERE OUTSOURCED BY BEIJING. IN TOTAL, THE SPILLOVER OF SO2 EMISSIONS INDUCED BY BEIJING WAS ESTIMATED AT 0.20 MT, 76 TIMES MORE THAN ITS OWN SHARE AS A RECEPTOR ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAINS. THIS STUDY IS COMPETENT FOR AN ANALYTIC FRAMEWORK OF STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR JOINT PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF AIR POLLUTION IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS CAN HELP REDUCE POLLUTION TRANSFER, PROPERLY TAX ON DRIVERS, EFFECTIVELY CONTROL THE EMITTERS, AND REASONABLY COMPENSATE THE RECEPTORS. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS OF VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS AND PROVIDE THE POTENTIAL OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS ON REGIONAL WATER SCARCITY. BASED ON THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL AND STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS, WE EVALUATED THE REDISTRIBUTION OF WATER WITHDRAWAL WITHIN CHINA IN 2002, 2007 AND 2012, AND THEN REVEALED THE HIDDEN DRIVING FORCES OF THE CHANGES IN VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS. FOR A SPECIFIC PROVINCE, THE DRIVERS HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO LOCAL AND THE REST OF CHINA. HERE WE FOUND THAT: (1) THE SHARE OF VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS IN INTERREGIONAL TRADE TO TOTAL WATER WITHDRAWAL HAD INCREASED (FROM 20.1\% TO 40.5\%) DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. (2) THE DIRECTION OF VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS HAS REVERSED BETWEEN SOME CHINESE REGIONS. NORTHWEST AND NORTHEAST REGIONS HAVE BECOME THE MAJOR VIRTUAL WATER EXPORTERS. (3) THE VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS HIDDEN IN TRADED PRODUCTS OF AGRICULTURE, ELECTRICITY AND THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 83\% OF TOTAL VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS. (4) LOCAL EFFICIENCY GAINS AND CONSUMPTION PATTERN CHANGES IN OTHER PROVINCES WERE THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR CHANGES IN VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS. THE WATER-SCARCE NORTHWEST AND NORTHEAST OF CHINA HAD FURTHER INCREASED VIRTUAL WATER EXPORT TO THE WATER-RICH PROVINCES IN SOUTHERN CHINA. THIS TREND COULD BE CURBED BY IMPROVING WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND RESTRAINING WATER-INTENSIVE CONSUMPTION.

THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE INFLUENCING FACTORS THAT LEAD TO DIFFERENT CONSUMPTION-BASED WATER FOOTPRINTS (WFS) PER CAPITA IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES/REGIONS, WITH EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENTIATING URBAN AND RURAL WFS AND EXAMINING THE ROLE OF URBANIZATION. STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS, WHICH IS CONVENTIONALLY USED FOR INVESTIGATING TEMPORAL CHANGES OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE, IS ADAPTED TO INSPECT THE FACTORS SHAPING SPATIAL DIFFERENCE. THIS ADAPTED APPROACH BREAKS DOWN THE DIFFERENCE OF WFS PER CAPITA BETWEEN PROVINCES INTO FIVE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS, I.E., URBANIZATION LEVEL, DIRECT WATER USE EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTION STRUCTURE, INHABITANT CONSUMPTION LEVEL AND CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE. ACCORDING TO WF ACCOUNTING BASED ON INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES IN BEIJING, TIANJIN AND HEBEI IN THE GREATER CAPITAL REGION OF CHINA IN 2010, THE URBAN WFS PER CAPITA ARE BETWEEN 1.6 AND 3.7 TIMES THE RURAL WFS. RESIDENTIAL WFS PER CAPITA IN BEIJING, TIANJIN AND HEBEI SHOW A LARGE VARIABILITY BETWEEN 114 M(3) AND 463 M(3). THE RESULTS OF THE ADAPTED STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT URBANIZATION AND RISING CONSUMPTION LEVELS, WHICH ARE TWO FORESEEABLE TRENDS WHEN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS IMPROVE, RESULT IN INCREASING WF PER CAPITA, WHEREAS THE DIRECT WATER USE EFFICIENCY, ECONOMIC PRODUCTION STRUCTURE AND CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OFFSET THE WF. INHABITANT CONSUMPTION LEVELS DOMINATE OTHER FACTORS RESULTING IN DIFFERENCES OF WF PER CAPITA BETWEEN PROVINCES.

FIRST, WE CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF A CARBON TAX OF US\$ 10 AND US\$ 50/METRIC TON OF CO2 EQUIVALENT. AS USUAL, THE ADOPTION OF THE CARBON TAX GENERATES ADVERSE EFFECTS ON GDP, WAGES AND JOBS IN THE SHORT TERM, BUT REDUCES EMISSIONS AND GENERATES NEW GOVERNMENT REVENUES, ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE GREATER TAX. SECOND, WE CONSIDER A BROADER TAX SYSTEM REFORM. IN THIS REFORM, WE REPLACE DISTORTIONARY TAXES BY A TAX ON VALUE ADDED.

TAKING THE WESTERN EUROPEAN CLOTHING SUPPLY CHAIN AS A CASE STUDY, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW APPLYING A NORMATIVE INDICATOR IN SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (SLCA) CAN CONTRIBUTE ACADEMIC AND PRACTICAL INSIGHTS INTO DEBATES ON FAIRNESS. TO DO SO, WE DEVELOP A NEW INDICATOR THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THE LIVING WAGE FOR SLCA. METHODS WE EXTEND THE STANDARD FORM OF LIVING WAGE AVAILABLE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO INCLUDE INCOME TAX AND SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS. WE CALL THIS EXTENSION `LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION'. USING PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE DATA, WE ESTIMATE NET LIVING WAGES, GROSS LIVING WAGES, AND LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION RATES FOR BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, AND CHINA (BRIC) IN 2005. WE THEN INTEGRATE LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION RATES INTO AN INPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK, WHICH WE USE TO COMPARE LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION AND ACTUAL LABOUR COMPENSATION IN THE BRIC COUNTRIES IN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN CLOTHING SUPPLY CHAIN IN 2005. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION WE FIND THAT IN 2005, ACTUAL LABOUR COMPENSATION IN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN CLOTHING SUPPLY CHAIN WAS AROUND HALF OF THE LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION LEVEL, WITH THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE BEING IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. THEREFORE, WE ARGUE THAT BRIC PAY IN THE WESTERN EUROPEAN CLOTHING SUPPLY CHAIN WAS UNFAIR. FURTHERMORE, OUR LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION ESTIMATES FOR BRIC IN 2005 ARE SIMILAR TO 35\% HIGHER THAN STANDARD LIVING WAGE ESTIMATES. INDEED, ADDING INCOME TAXES AND EMPLOYEE SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS ALONE INCREASES THE LIVING WAGE BY SIMILAR TO 10\%. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARGUE THERE IS A RISK THAT INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON LIVING WAGES ARE NOT USING A REPRESENTATIVE MEASURE OF FAIRNESS FROM THE EMPLOYEE'S PERSPECTIVE AND ARE SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERESTIMATING THE COST OF LIVING WAGES FROM AN EMPLOYER'S PERSPECTIVE. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS FOR RETAILERS AND LIVING WAGE ADVOCACY GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS LIVING LABOUR COMPENSATION EXTENDS THE LIVING WAGE, MAINTAINING ITS STRENGTHS AND ADDRESSING KEY WEAKNESSES. IT CAN BE ESTIMATED FOR MULTIPLE COUNTRIES FROM PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE DATA AND CAN BE APPLIED IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK. THEREFORE, IT IS ABLE TO PROVIDE A NORMATIVE ASSESSMENT OF FAIRNESS IN COMPLEX GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS.

IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION MODEL BY USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS WITH GROSS REGIONAL PRODUCT (GRP) MAXIMIZATION AS THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTION. THIS MODEL CONTAINS THREE SUBMODELS: THE SOCIOECONOMIC SUBMODEL, ATMO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SUBMODEL, AND ENERGY SUBMODEL. THE MODEL IS APPLIED TO TANGSHAN CITY, A TYPICAL RESOURCE-BASED INDUSTRIAL CITY, TO CONDUCT A DYNAMIC SIMULATION WITH 13 TERMS FROM 2013 TO 2025 AND BASED ON THE DATA IN 2012. THE GOAL FOR THE MODEL OPERATION IS TO REALIZE THE OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT OF A SOCIAL ECONOMY UNDER THE RESTRAIN OF CERTAIN EMISSION LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTANTS. THIS GOAL IS ACHIEVED BY INTRODUCING A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY THAT INCLUDES A RESIDENTIAL CLEAN ENERGY PROMOTION POLICY AND AN INDUSTRY EMISSION REDUCTION POLICY, AND INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING ALSO PLAYS A ROLE BY INDUSTRIAL SUBSIDIES.

FIVE ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS (MARINE ECO-TOXICITY, TERRESTRIAL ECO-TOXICITY, PHOTOCHEMICAL OXIDATION, TERRESTRIAL ACIDIFICATION, AND EUTROPHICATION) WERE NEEDED TO COVER 95\% OF THE VARIANCE. IN COMPARISON, A STATISTICALLY OPTIMAL SET OF SEVEN INDICATORS EXPLAINED 95\% OF THE VARIANCE AS WELL.

THE EFFECT OF RESOURCE CONSUMPTION INDUCES A CHANGE IN AN ECONOMY'S PRODUCTION STRUCTURE AND ALTERS THE TECHNICAL COEFFICIENT OF THE HYBRID I-O TABLE, WHICH SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED. OUR STUDY EXAMINES THIS PROBLEM BASED ON TWO CASES: A SMALL CUT-OFF RATIO FROM THE EXISTING INDUSTRY, IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN THE TECHNICAL COEFFICIENT CAN BE IGNORED, AND A LARGE CUT-OFF RATIO FROM THE EXISTING INDUSTRY, IN WHICH THE TECHNICAL COEFFICIENT IS AMENDED USING THE PRE-ADJUSTMENT METHOD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE BIOMASS POWER PLANT USING THE LARGE CUT-OFF RATIO FROM THE EXISTING INDUSTRY CASE CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 1114 MILLION YEN TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. A COMPARISON OF THESE TWO CASES SHOWS THAT THE ERROR CAUSED BY IGNORANCE OF THE TECHNICAL COEFFICIENT ADJUSTMENT COULD RESULT IN 291.78 MILLION YEN LESS IN TOTAL ECONOMIC PRODUCTION, WHICH IS ABOUT 36\% OF THE TOTAL ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION USING THE SMALL CUT-OFF RATIO FROM THE EXISTING INDUSTRY CASE.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF A TERRITORIAL-BASED AND A CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH TO ESTIMATE BOTH DIRECT AND EMBODIED RESOURCE USE AND POLLUTION FLOWS FOR THE CASE OF BRUSSELS CAPITAL REGION (BELGIUM). THE TERRITORIAL-BASED APPROACH IS BASED ON LOCAL ENERGY, WATER AND MATERIAL CONSUMPTION MEASURED DATA AS WELL AS MEASURED DATA ON WASTE GENERATION AND POLLUTION EMISSIONS. THE ESTIMATION OF INDIRECT RESOURCE USE AND POLLUTION EMISSIONS (OR CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH) IS BASED ON THE REGIONAL 10-TABLES OF THE CITY-REGION OF BRUSSELS EXTENDED WITH MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GLOBAL FLOWS OF CONSUMPTION. THE COMPARISON OF THESE TWO APPROACHES IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN THE CASE OF CITIES THAT HAVE LIMITED PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES AND LIMITED OR NO EXTRACTION OF MATERIALS AS THE IMPACT ON THE HINTERLAND IS OFTEN UNDERESTIMATED OR NEGLECTED BY LOCAL (ENVIRONMENTAL) POLICIES WHICH ARE ONLY BASED ON TERRITORIAL BASED FIGURES.

MILD OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION (MOFC) COMBINES THE ADVANTAGES OF THE MODERATE AND INTENSE LOW-OXYGEN DILUTION (MILD) COMBUSTION AND OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION (OFC) TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY JUSTIFIED CO2 CAPTURE FROM FOSSIL FUEL-BASED POWER GENERATION. THE ADVANTAGES OF MOFC APPLICATION ARE: (I) IT INCREASES THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COAL-FIRED BOILER, (II) IT INCREASES THE PURITY OF THE CO2 IN THE FLUE GASES, (III) IT REDUCES THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION OF THE BOILER BY USING LOWER OXIDISER EXCESS, AND (IV) IT REDUCES THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION ASSOCIATED WITH CO2 RECIRCULATION. THEREFORE, USING MOFC DECREASES THE PENALTY OF THE OVERALL NET ENERGY EFFICIENCY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CO2 CAPTURE FROM COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS IN THIS STUDY CONSIDERED THE TEC, WHICH MEASURES THE DEPLETION OF NON-RENEWABLE NATURAL RESOURCES BY ESTIMATING THE CUMULATIVE EXERGY CONSUMED BY THE PRODUCTION PROCESSES. MOREOVER, THE ADDITIONAL EXERGY CONSUMPTION THAT COMPENSATES FOR THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF HARMFUL EMISSIONS HAS ALSO BEEN CONSIDERED. THE DATA FOR THE NEW BOILER DESIGN WERE OBTAINED BY CFD MODELLING, WHILE THE OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL MODULES OF THE INTEGRATED MOFC POWER PLANT WERE MODELLED BY PROCESS MODELLING SOFTWARE. THE DATA CONCERNING THE CO2 TRANSPORT, UTILISATION, AND STORAGE WERE OBTAINED FROM THE AVAILABLE DATABASES AND LITERATURE. THREE CONFIGURATIONS OF THE POWER PLANT WERE MODELLED AND ANALYSED FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL POINT OF VIEW. THE FIRST TWO WERE THE REFERENCE COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS (THE CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANT AND THE OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION POWER PLANT WITH CO2 CAPTURE), WHILE THE THIRD CASE USED THE SAME POWER PLANT CONFIGURATION BUT WITH AN MOFC BOILER.

THIS RAPID URBANIZATION HAS STIMULATED THE GROWTH OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION. TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF URBANIZATION ON CHINESE HOUSEHOLDS' ENERGY CONSUMPTION, THIS PAPER ANALYZED THE CHANGES IN HOUSEHOLDS' DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION (DEC) AND CALCULATED HOUSEHOLDS' INDIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION (IEC) BASED ON AN ENERGY INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. BY APPLYING AN INPUT-OUTPUT STRUCTURE DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS MODEL, THIS PAPER QUANTITATIVELY MEASURED THE IMPACTS OF URBANIZATION ON THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF HOUSEHOLDS IN CHINA. WE FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF CHINA'S URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' DEC GRADUALLY INCREASED FROM 48.7 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT TO 185.2 MILLION TONS OF OIL EQUIVALENT. IN 2012, THE PROPORTION OF COAL PRODUCTS IN URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' DEC DECREASED FROM 91.4\% IN 1980 TO 24.3\%, WHILE THE PROPORTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, AND ELECTRICITY IN URBAN HOUSEHOLDS' DEC INCREASED.

DURING THESE YEARS, THE WATER RESOURCES DIRECTLY USED BY THE EU COUNTRIES DISPLAYED A GROWING BUT SMOOTH TREND. HOWEVER, EUROPEAN ACTIVITIES INTENSIVELY DEMANDED WATER RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN. THE GROWTH RATE OF EMBODIED WATER USE WAS THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE GROWTH IN WATER DIRECTLY USED BY THESE ECONOMIES. THIS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE LARGE UPSURGE OF VIRTUAL WATER IMPORTS IN THE EU (E.G., ABOUT 25\% OF THE CHANGE IN WATER IMPORTS IN THE WORLD WAS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE INCREASING IMPORTS IN THE EU27 COUNTRIES). IN THIS CONTEXT, WE ANALYZE WATER USE CHANGES IN THE EU27 FROM 1995 TO 2009, COMBINING THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVES. TO THAT AIM, WE USE THE ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH TO OBTAIN THE VOLUME OF WATER EMBODIED IN DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND IN TRADE FLOWS AT THE SECTOR AND COUNTRY LEVELS. IN THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS, WE UTILIZE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT DATA FROM THE WORLD INPUT OUTPUT DATABASE. IN ADDITION, BY MEANS OF A STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS WE IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY THE FACTORS EXPLAINING CHANGES IN THESE TRENDS. WE FOCUS BOTH ON THE ROLE OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND TRADE AND ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATED INTENSITY, TECHNOLOGY AND SCALE EFFECTS.

USING CROP SUITABILITY AREAS AND METAL RESERVE BASE DATA, WE CALCULATE SCARCITY-WEIGHTED LAND AND METAL FOOTPRINTS FOR THE MAJOR ECONOMIES WITH THE EXIOBASE GLOBAL MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. SCARCITY-WEIGHTING CAUSES A SIGNIFICANT REORDERING OF THE GLOBAL RANKINGS OF COUNTRIES FOR BOTH LAND AND METAL FOOTPRINTS. LAND SCARCITY FOCUSES MOSTLY ON CEREALS (54\% FROM THE TOTAL AGRICULTURAL LAND USED) AND OIL CROPS (15\%), THE FORMER BEING NOTABLY AFFECTED BY WATER SCARCITY ISSUES IN ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. METAL SCARCITY FOCUSES ON COPPER ORES (69\%) AND IRON (-11\%), THE FORMER BEING A GLOBALLY SCARCE METAL IMPACTING MULTIPLE ECONOMIES.

THIS MEANS THAT FROM A CARBON FOOTPRINT PERSPECTIVE POWERTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION IS BENEFICIAL ONLY TO A CERTAIN DEGREE AT THE CURRENT STAGE. THIS SITUATION CAN BE CHANGED BY INCREASING SHARES OF RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY IN THE GRID. IN OUR BEST-CASE SCENARIO, WHERE RENEWABLE ENERGY ACCOUNTS FOR 96\% OF THE ELECTRICITY MIX IN 2050, ELECTRIC VEHICLE CARBON FOOTPRINTS CAN BE CUT BY 66\% BY 2050 RELATIVE TO 2009.

THE VARYING TRENDS OF AIR POLLUTANTS FROM 2007 TO 2012 WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION-BASED CONTROL MEASURES AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AND TRADING PATTERNS. FROM THE CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO THE STRINGENT CONTROL OF SO2 IN POWER PLANTS AND KEY INDUSTRIES, THE SO2 EMISSIONS UNDERWENT SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES, WHILE THE LESS CONTROLLED PM10, PM25, VOC AND CO EMISSIONS CONTINUED TO GROW. THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CLEANER (THAT IS, WITH LOWER EMISSION INTENSITY) SERVICE SECTORS (THIRD-SECTOR INDUSTRIES, EXCLUDING TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND POST) TO ALL SEVEN POLLUTANTS INCREASED.

BECAUSE OF THE CLOSER INTERREGIONAL ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS THAT HAVE FORMED, IN THIS STUDY WE FOCUS ON THE VIRTUAL FLOWS OF POLLUTANTS EMBODIED IN INTERPROVINCIAL TRADE. WE COMPARED TWO METHODS, EMBODIED EMISSIONS IN BILATERAL TRADE (EEBT) AND THE MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) MODEL, TO DETERMINE EMISSION FLOWS FOR 2002 AND 2007 AND FOUND THAT THE RESULTS BETWEEN THESE TWO APPROACHES DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY, PARTICULARLY FOR THE YEAR 2007. THIS INDICATES THAT THE CHOICE OF THE ACCOUNTING METHOD HAS OBVIOUS IMPACTS ON SUBSEQUENT DECISIONS. FURTHER ANALYSIS BASED ON THE MRIO METHOD, WHICH CAPTURES THE COMPLETE INTERREGIONAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND IS MORE APPLICABLE TO CONSUMPTION-BASED STUDIES, SHOWED THAT THE EMBODIED SO2 EMISSIONS IN INTERPROVINCIAL TRADE ACCOUNTED FOR 27.58\% OF THE TOTAL SO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA IN 2002 AND 35.25\% IN 2007. INNER MONGOLIA, SHANXI, AND GUIZHOU WERE THE MAJOR EMBODIED EMISSION-EXPORTING REGIONS, WITH SOURCES MAINLY FROM THE ELECTRICITY, NONMETAL MINERAL PRODUCTION, CHEMICALS, AND METAL SMELTING SECTORS. THE EXPORTED EMISSIONS MAINLY ENDED UP IN RICH PROVINCES, INCLUDING BEIJING, TIANJIN, SHANGHAI, AND GUANGDONG, DUE TO THOSE PROVINCES' FINAL DEMANDS FOR PRODUCTS OF THE CONSTRUCTION, FOOD PRODUCTION, AND TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING SECTORS. FURTHERMORE, RICH PROVINCES WERE NET IMPORTERS IN INTERPROVINCIAL TRADE, WITH A POLLUTION TERMS OF TRADE VALUE LESS THAN ONE. THE RESULTS YIELD IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINA'S AIR POLLUTION CONTROLS: EMISSION REDUCTION TASKS SHOULD BE REASONABLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG PROVINCES TO PREVENT DEVELOPED PROVINCES FROM OUTSOURCING MORE POLLUTION EMISSIONS TO LESS DEVELOPED PROVINCES THROUGH INTERPROVINCIAL TRADE; REGULATION OF CONSUMPTION IN DEVELOPED PROVINCES WOULD HELP TO CONTROL NATIONAL POLLUTION; FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR POLLUTION CONTROL SHOULD FAVOR THE LESS DEVELOPED REGIONS.

THE MULTIPLE REBATE REVENUE REACHES 422.14 MILLION DOLLARS, AND THE PROBLEM OF MULTIPLE REBATES IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS FOR THE SECTORS WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF GLOBAL PRODUCTION FRAGMENTATION, SUCH AS THE ELECTRICAL AND OPTICAL EQUIPMENT SECTOR. IN ADDITION, EXPORT REBATES ARE MAINLY TARGETED AT THE CARBON EMISSIONS THAT ARE GENERATED IN THE ELECTRICITY GENERATION SECTOR AND EMBODIED IN EXPORTS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD.

A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE THAT LIMITS THE APPLICABILITY OF UTILITY ANALYSIS IS THAT ITS MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION REQUIRES THE CONVERGENCE OF A MATRIX POWER SERIES, WHICH MAY FAIL FOR OTHERWISE PERFECTLY VALID ECOSYSTEM MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, UTILITY ANALYSIS FOR THE WELL KNOWN NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY NITROGEN FLOW MODELS (BAIRD AND ULANOWICZ, 1989), COLLECTED OVER 4 YEARS (16 SEASONS TOTAL), DO NOT CONVERGE FOR SOME SEASONS, BUT CONVERGE FOR OTHERS.

MATERIAL FOOTPRINT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE 2008 ECONOMIC CRISIS. IN RELATIVE TERMS, THE SHARE OF SPANISH HOUSEHOLDS' MATERIAL FOOTPRINT, WITH RESPECT TO TOTAL MATERIAL FOOTPRINT, DECREASED DRASTICALLY FROM 70.7\% IN 2006 TO 50.8\% IN 2011. THIS REDUCTION CAN BE MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR CRASH (34.4\% OF THE REDUCTION IS DUE TO CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS), FOLLOWED BY BIOMASS (29\%), METALS (27.1\%) AND FOSSIL FUELS (26.1\%). BY TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD, THE MATERIAL FOOTPRINT EXHIBITS A SCALE EFFECT WHILE CONSUMPTION AND INCOME LEVELS GROW; AND THIS IS ACCOMPANIED BY A GLOBAL TELECONNECTION EFFECT, WHICH VARIES FROM 62\% FOR BIOMASS, TO 64\% FOR METALS, TO 82\% FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS, TO 95\% FOR FOSSIL FUELS.

AT THE SAME TIME THE PRESSURE TO CONSIDER SOCIAL ISSUES IN GLOBAL AND INTERCONNECTED SUPPLY CHAINS HAS RISEN AS WELL. THESE ISSUES POSE RISK TO SUPPLY CHAINS SINCE THEIR OCCURRENCE MAY CAUSE ADVERSE STAKEHOLDER REACTION THROUGH E.G. REPUTATIONAL LOSSES. DESPITE THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT AS A KEY PROCESS WITHIN SUPPLY CHAINS AND THE FREQUENTLY ARTICULATED DEMAND FOR A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ASSOCIATED RISKS, SUCH APPROACHES ARE MISSING SO FAR.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A TWO-STEP HIERARCHICAL APPROACH IS DEVELOPED. FIRST, ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (EIO-LCA) IS UTILIZED TO QUANTIFY THE GHG EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE US RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUILDING STOCK. SECOND, A MIXED INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING (MILP) BASED OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL GHG EMISSIONS' REDUCTION (PERCENT) FOR EACH INDUSTRY ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK OF THE US ECONOMY. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ``READY-MIX CONCRETE MANUFACTURING'' ``ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION'' AND ``LIGHTING FIXTURE MANUFACTURING'' SECTORS WERE FOUND TO BE THE MAIN CULPRITS IN THE GHG EMISSIONS' STOCK. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAJORLY RESPONSIBLE INDUSTRIES IN THE SUPPLY CHAINS OF EACH BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CATEGORIES WERE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED AS THE HOT-SPOTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAINS WITH RESPECT TO THE GHG EMISSION REDUCTION (PERCENT) REQUIREMENTS.

INPUT-OUTPUT MATRICES WERE USED FOR THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE HICKS-MOORSTEEN TFP INDEX. THE GOAL IS TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE REAL TFP IN THE DOWNTURN AND RECOVERY PHASES OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE IN AGRICULTURE. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE REACTION OF TFP TO BUSINESS CYCLE CHANGES ON ``SMALL'' ``MEDIUM'' AND EVEN ``LARGE'' FAMILY FARMS IN POLAND IS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE TO THAT OBSERVED IN THE CASE OF LARGE-SCALE FARMS. MORE THAN 90\% OF FARMS IN POLAND (EXCEPT FOR THE LARGEST) INCREASE TECHNICAL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND LOWER IT IN THE CONDITIONS OF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. SUCH BEHAVIOUR IS PRO-CYCLIC AND IRRATIONAL, ALLUDING TO THE 17TH-CENTURY KING'S EFFECT, WHICH IS VANISHING IN THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS OF HIGHLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

IN THIS PAPER, EMBODIED EMISSION OF PM2.5 FROM EACH SECTOR OF BEIJING IS QUANTIFIED BASED ON INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (LOA). FORTY-TWO ECONOMIC SECTORS FROM THE INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE ARE AGGREGATED INTO FIFTEEN COMPONENTS. FURTHERMORE, THE MUTUAL INTERACTIONS AND CONTROL RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THOSE SECTORS HAVE BEEN REVEALED BY USING ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA) TO IDENTIFY THE DOMINANT SECTORS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN 2010, 34\% OF THE TOTAL PM2.5 EMISSIONS, OR 59.4 KT PM2.5, WERE INDIRECT EMISSIONS TRADED THROUGH ECONOMIC SECTORS WITHIN BEIJING. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF ENA, WE FOUND THAT ``SMELTING \& PRESSING OF METALS'' ``METAL PRODUCTS'' AND ``NONMETAL MINERAL PRODUCTS'' ARE THE TOP THREE SECTORS WITH THE HIGHEST CONTROL LEVELS WHILE ``AGRICULTURE'' ``CATERING SERVICES'' AND ``RESIDENTIAL SERVICES'' ARE THE LOWEST-RANKING SECTORS AMONG THE SYSTEM.

THE ECONOMIC SECTORS OF THESE SMALLER COASTAL COMMUNITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN DRIVEN BY MARINE BASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES LIKE FISHING. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE FISHING SECTOR AND IN SOME COMMUNITIES OTHER MARINE RELATED ACTIVITIES SUCH AS AQUACULTURE, TOURISM, OFF SHORE OIL AND GAS, PORTS, AND TRANSPORT (COLLECTIVELY CALLED THE MARINE SECTOR) ARE GROWING INSTEAD. THE INDUSTRY MAKEUP OF THE MARINE SECTOR IS CHANGING, WHICH PRESENTS CHALLENGES TO SOME COASTAL COMMUNITIES FORCED TO RESHAPE THEIR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND DIVERSIFY ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO OF MARINE INDUSTRIES. DOING SO REQUIRES INTRICATELY LINKED NETWORKS OF BUSINESSES AND SERVICES, POTENTIALLY ACROSS INDUSTRIES, THAT EACH RELY ON A FLOW OF INPUTS FROM THEIR SUPPLIERS AND DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRIES TO TAKE THEIR PRODUCT. USING AUSTRALIA AS A CASE-STUDY, THIS STUDY USES NATIONAL LEVEL INPUT-OUTPUT (10) DATA TO QUANTIFY INDUSTRY CONNECTIONS TO DIFFERENT MARINE INDUSTRIES AND ASSESS THOSE THAT MAY BE CRUCIAL FOR THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OR FUTURE GROWTH OF THE MARINE SECTOR. RESULTS SHOW THAT WHILE FISHING AND AQUACULTURE ARE RELIANT ON SEVERAL OVERLAPPING UP- AND DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRIES, AND SOME SYNERGIES EXIST WITH MARINE TOURISM, THERE IS LITTLE OVERLAP WITH OTHER MARINE INDUSTRIES. ALTHOUGH MARINE TOURISM IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN SMALL REGIONAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL STATES, EMPLOYMENT IN FISHING AND AQUACULTURE IS MORE IMPORTANT IN SMALL REGIONAL COASTAL COMMUNITIES THAN IN ANY OTHER TYPE OF COMMUNITY.

THE TOP-DOWN APPROACH IS BASED ON ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AND QUANTIFIES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRODUCT GROUPS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY INDUSTRIAL SECTORS. THE BOTTOM-UP APPROACH IS BASED ON LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND QUANTIFIES THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A SELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE PRODUCTS. THE BOTTOM-UP APPROACH HAS ALREADY BEEN USED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S JOINT RESEARCH CENTRE TO CALCULATE THE IMPACTS OF THE FINAL CONSUMPTION PER CAPITA IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN 2006. IN THIS PAPER, WE CALCULATED THESE IMPACTS THROUGH A TOP-DOWN APPROACH, USING THE EXIOBASE DATABASE. THE COVERED HOUSEHOLD ACTIVITIES ARE FOOD, CONSUMER GOODS, MOBILITY, SHELTER AND SERVICES.

CHINA'S STEEL OUTPUT REACHED 220 MILLION TONS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2003, BECOMING THE FIRST COUNTRY WHOSE ANNUAL PRODUCTION EXCEEDED 200 MILLION TONS. THE IRON AND STEEL IS AN INDUSTRY OF HIGH ENERGY CONSUMPTION, HIGH POLLUTION AND HIGH EMISSIONS WHICH HAS ATTRACTED DEEP CONCERN OF CHINESE GOVERNMENT. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS ESTIMATED THE DIRECT CO2 EMISSIONS IN INDIVIDUAL PROCESSES OF IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION, WHILE RESEARCH ON THE INDIRECT CO2 EMISSIONS FROM THE RELATED SECTORS OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY IS SCARCE. TO EXPLORE THE WHOLE CO2 EMISSIONS, THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CARBON EMISSIONS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY AND CARBON EMISSION DEDUCTION BY BUILDING AN ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (EIO-LCA) MODEL BASED ON THE LATEST AVAILABLE DATA OF THE INPUT-OUTPUT EXTENSION TABLE IN 2010 AND CHINA'S ENERGY STATISTICAL YEARBOOK IN 2011. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT COKE AND COAL PRODUCE THE MOST DIRECT CO2 EMISSIONS AND RAW CHEMICAL MATERIALS, MEDICAL AND CHEMICAL FIBER MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION STORAGE AND THE POSTAL INDUSTRY, THE ELECTRICITY HEAT PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY INDUSTRY, NONMETAL MINERAL PRODUCTION, PETROLEUM PROCESSING OF COKE AND NUCLEAR FUEL PROCESSING, COAL MINING AND DRESSING ARE THE SIX SECTORS THAT PRODUCE THE LARGEST INDIRECT CO2 EMISSIONS AMONG THE 35 SECTORS IN THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY. BASED ON THE RESULTS, WE SUGGEST THAT CHINA SHOULD (1) IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF COKE AND COAL, INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF COKE AND COAL, COAL BLENDING TECHNOLOGY AND THE COKES' STRENGTH, AND EMPLOY THE SCRAP OR CITIES' MINERALS AS MAIN RAW MATERIALS IN THE PRODUCTION, AND AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT AND ENTERPRISES MAY INCREASE TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION; (2) AND USE HIGH-STRENGTH IRON AND STEEL INSTEAD OF THE ORDINARY ONE.

THUS, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES THE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER TRADE, AS WELL AS PRODUCTION-AND CONSUMPTION-BASED AGRICULTURAL WATER FOOTPRINTS IN CHINA BY USING AN INPUT OUTPUT MODEL DURING 1997-2010. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, CHINA'S AVERAGE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER INTENSITY SHOWS A DECLINING TREND FROM 43.33 M(3)/THOUSAND YUAN IN 1997 TO 32.66 M(3)/ THOUSAND YUAN IN 2010. THE AVERAGE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER INTENSITY OF THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INDUSTRIES. CHINA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A NET EXPORTER OF AGRICULTURAL WATER. AT THE INDUSTRIAL LEVEL, THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS A NET IMPORTER BECAUSE OF THE INCREASING FOOD DEMAND IN CHINA, THE SECONDARY INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN A NET EXPORTER, AND THE TERTIARY INDUSTRY HAS MAINTAINED A TRADE BALANCE. THE PRODUCTION-AND CONSUMPTION-BASED EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER USES DEMONSTRATE SIMILAR CHANGING TRENDS: BOTH DECREASE FROM 1997 TO 2007 AND THEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE IN 2010. THE EMBODIED AGRICULTURAL WATER CONSUMED BY THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY SHOWS A DOWNWARD TREND, WHEREAS THOSE CONSUMED BY THE SECONDARY AND TERTIARY INDUSTRIES DEMONSTRATE AN OPPOSITE TREND. THEREFORE, IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL WATER EFFICIENCY, ADJUSTMENTS IN CONSUMPTION AND TRADE STRUCTURE ARE HIGHLY INSTRUMENTAL TO THE CONSERVATION OF LOCAL AGRICULTURAL WATER RESOURCES.

THIS DEMONSTRATES THE GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO DEAL WITH CARBON EMISSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. ALTHOUGH THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS NOT A CARBON EMISSION-INTENSIVE INDUSTRY, ITS LARGE SCALE MAKES THE EMISSION REDUCTION IN THE INDUSTRY VERY IMPORTANT. BASED ON THE INPUT OUTPUT STRUCTURAL DECOMPOSITION METHOD, THIS PAPER CALCULATES THE CO2 EMISSIONS OF CHINA'S FOOD INDUSTRY FROM 1991 TO 2012, AND DECOMPOSES THE CHANGE IN CO2 EMISSIONS OF THE INDUSTRY DURING 1992-1997, 1997-2002, 2002-2007 AND 2007-2010 INTO FOUR MAIN EFFECTS: EMISSION FACTOR, ENERGY STRUCTURE, ENERGY INTENSITY, AND TOTAL OUTPUT (INCLUDING FOUR SUB-EFFECTS: INTERMEDIATE USE, DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, IMPORT SUBSTITUTION AND EXPORT EXTENSION). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHANGES IN CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY MAINLY DEPENDS ON TOTAL OUTPUT EFFECT AND ENERGY INTENSITY EFFECT. ENERGY INTENSITY EFFECT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS, AS IT REDUCED CUMULATIVE 213 MILLION TONS (MT) CO2 EMISSIONS OF THE INDUSTRY. AMONG TOTAL OUTPUT EFFECT, THE EFFECTS OF INTERMEDIATE USE AND DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND ARE THE TWO BIGGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO CARBON EMISSIONS. FINALLY, WE PROVIDE SOME POLICY ADVICES FOR CONSTRAINING AND REDUCING CO2 EMISSIONS OF CHINA'S FOOD INDUSTRY. THE ADVICES INCLUDE INCREASING R\&D INVESTMENT AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF ENERGY WITH OTHER INPUT FACTORS TO DECREASE ENERGY INTENSITY, INCREASING THE ADDED VALUE OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY, OPTIMIZING THE ENERGY STRUCTURE WITH MORE CLEAN AND LOW-CARBON ENERGY, AND MAINTAINING THE PRICES OF RAW MATERIALS OF THE FOOD INDUSTRY (I.E.

MOREOVER, THE CONCEPT OF DEPENDENCE ON TRADED CO2 WAS PROPOSED FOR ANALYZING MUTUAL DEPENDENCE OF CHINA AND JAPAN'S CARBON EMISSION AND ECONOMY. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA WAS A NET EXPORTER OF EMBODIED CO2 EMISSIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN TRADE, BUT BOTH CHINA'S EXPORTED EMISSIONS AND NET EMISSION TRANSFER TO JAPAN BEGAN TO DECREASE AFTER 2007. MORE EMISSIONS WERE EMBODIED IN MORE ADVANCED AND LESS CARBON INTENSIVE PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY FOR CHINA'S EXPORTS.

REACHING HIGHER LEVELS OF REUSE, RECYCLING AND ENERGY RECOVERY MAY PROVIDE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES (I.E., IN TERMS OF GDP, JOBS, REDUCED IMPACTS), BUT NOT ALL OPTIONS WILL HAVE A NET WIN-WIN-WIN PROPERTY IN PRACTICE, AS THEY REDUCE THE NEED FOR PRODUCING NEW COMMODITIES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO QUANTIFY THE RESPECTIVE IMPACTS ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES OF AN ELECTRICALLY POWERED OR PETROL FUELLED PRIVATE CAR. IN ORDER TO DO THIS, WE ESTABLISH AN INTEGRATED METHOD OF VALUATION, COVERING BOTH MANUFACTURE AND USE OF THE VEHICLE, WITH LOCATION OF THESE TWO STAGES WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY CONCERNED. FROM A ``DEPTH'' PERSPECTIVE, IT INCORPORATES THE ECONOMIC PROCEEDS FROM THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND WHAT THEY CONSUME, AND FROM A ``BREADTH'' PERSPECTIVE IT INCORPORATES THE FISCAL EFFECTS (VAT, FUEL AND ENERGY TAXES, TAX ON PRODUCTION, ETC.)

WE HYPOTHESIZE AN ADDITIONAL TYPE OF ACTIVITY FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AND WE MODEL IT WITHIN THE INTERSECTORIAL MATRIX ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION. APPLICATION OF THE METHOD TO FRANCE REVEALS FIRST THAT THE IMPACT OF A VEHICLE ON THE PUBLIC FINANCES IS SUBSTANTIAL: MANUFACTURE CONTRIBUTES APPROXIMATELY THE PURCHASE PRICE EXCLUDING VAT, AND USAGE ADDS AN AMOUNT OF THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE REVENUES (APPROXIMATELY 70\%) ARISE FROM THE SOCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY VALUE OF EMPLOYMENT; VAT ACCOUNTS FOR ALMOST 20\%, TAX ON PRODUCTION AROUND 5\%, AND ENERGY TAXES 9\% FOR A CV VEHICLE OR 1\% FOR AN EV. THEN, FOUR CASES FOR SUBSTITUTION OF EV TO CV ARE SET UP AND ASSESSED, DEPENDING ON THE PLACES EITHER DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN IN WHICH THE VEHICLE IS MANUFACTURED AND USED, RESPECTIVELY. IN THE BASE CASE, WHERE THE VEHICLE IS BOTH MANUFACTURED AND USED INSIDE THE COUNTRY, SUBSTITUTING AN EV TO A CV WOULD BE FINANCIALLY NEUTRAL FOR PUBLIC FINANCES AT LEAST BEFORE ANY PURCHASE INCENTIVE BONUS. THE EXPORT CASE, WHERE AN EV IS SUBSTITUTED TO A CV IN DOMESTIC PRODUCTION BUT THEN EXPORTED AND HENCE USED OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, YIELDS AN ADDITIONAL REVENUE OF ABOUT 8000 TO THE DOMESTIC PUBLIC FINANCES (WITHOUT BONUS); THE IMPORT CASE HAS AN OPPOSITE EFFECT.

THE METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH SEVERAL CASE STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ALLOCATION POLICIES GEARED TOWARDS REDUCING THE IMPACT OF DISRUPTIONS ATTRIBUTED TO CRITICAL RESOURCES, COMMODITIES, OR CAPITAL. RESULTS SHOW THAT DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES, COMMODITIES OR CAPITAL WILL SATISFY THE FINAL DEMANDS OF SOME ECONOMIC SECTORS AND REDUCE THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OTHERS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE REDUCTION OF TOTAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT. THOUGH SIMILAR RESULTS CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH TRADITIONAL MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING MODELS, THE PROCESS GRAPH PLATFORM HAS THE ADVANTAGE TO VISUALLY PRESENT THE DISTRIBUTION OF SCARCE RESOURCES, COMMODITIES OR CAPITAL WITHIN THE SYSTEM. THIS WORK IS A FIRST ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT THE PROCESS GRAPH APPROACH IN THE FIELDS OF ECONOMICS AND CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION. IN CONCLUSION, THE PROCESS GRAPH BASED APPROACH DEVELOPED IN THIS WORK CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE POLICYMAKERS WITH INSIGHTS IN DEVELOPING APPROPRIATE RISK MITIGATION PLANS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED CRISIS CONDITIONS. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDE BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS MEASURES FOR ANTICIPATED DISRUPTIONS, AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REAL-TIME EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THE MIDST OF A CRISIS.

HOWEVER, THE SECTORS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND COSTS PER TON-KM. RECENT PRESSURE TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS HAS MOTIVATED A SEARCH FOR MORE EFFICIENT FREIGHT MODE CHOICES. ONE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO SHIFT FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION AWAY FROM MODES THAT REQUIRE MORE ENERGY AND EMIT MORE (E.G., TRUCK) TO MODES THAT CONSUME AND EMIT LESS (E.G., RAIL AND WATER). OUR RESULTS SHOW THERE ARE NO INDIVIDUAL SECTORS FOR WHICH TARGETING CHANGES WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE TOTAL FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION ENERGY AND EMISSIONS, THEREFORE WE HAVE ALSO LOOKED AT THE PROSPECT OF POLICIES ENCOURAGING MANY SECTORS TO SHIFT MODES. THERE ARE FOUR SCENARIOS ANALYZED: (1) SHIFTING ALL TRUCK TO RAIL, SHIFTING TOP 20\% SECTOR MODE CHOICE, (2) BASED ON THEIR EMISSIONS, (3) BASED ON A MULTI-ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS, AND (4) INCREASING TRUCK EFFICIENCY (E.G., MPG).

RESULTS SHOW THAT ALL THREE REACHES ARE NET VIRTUAL WATER EXPORTER, I.E. PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE BASIN ALSO PUT PRESSURE ON THE WATER RESOURCES IN THE YRB. THE RESULTS SUGGEST A REDUCTION OF THE EXPORT OF VIRTUAL BLUE WATER THAT COULD INSTEAD BE USED FOR PRODUCING HIGHER VALUE ADDED BUT LOWER WATER-INTENSIVE GOODS.

THE ESSENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF SERVICES, AND ESPECIALLY OF SOME OF THEIR ACTIVITIES, CONSISTS OF POSITIVE IMPACT THEY PRODUCE ON USER ACTIVITIES. IN THIS WORK THE TERTIARISATION OF PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS OF SEVERAL EUROPEAN UNION (EU) NEW AND OLD MEMBER STATES, EMPLOYING THE INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES, IS ANALYZED. TO BE PRECISE, THE TERTIARISATION EFFECTS OBTAINED USING TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS AND LEONTIEF INVERSE MATRIX COEFFICIENTS ARE THOROUGHLY EXAMINED. OUR ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE DIRECT AND TOTAL EFFECTS. DIRECT EFFECTS COMPRISE THE IMMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE DEMAND OF EACH PRODUCTIVE SECTOR NECESSARY TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL UNIT OF ITS PRODUCT. ON THE OTHER HAND, TOTAL EFFECTS MEASURE ALL THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUTS NEEDED TO PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL UNIT OF OUTPUT. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SELECTED COUNTRIES REFERS TO THEIR REDUCED SIZE THAT CAN BE COMPARED TO THE NUTS 2 REGIONS. THE EU, ESTABLISHING ITS REGIONAL POLICY, WHICH MAIN GOAL CONSISTS IN THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND TERRITORIAL COHESION, TAKES INTO ACCOUNT REGIONS PRECISELY OF THIS LEVEL. SO, THIS ANALYSIS ENABLES NOT ONLY TO COMPARE THE STATE OF TERTIARISATION IN THE NEW AND OLD EUROPEAN MEMBER COUNTRIES, BUT ALSO TO APPROACH THIS ANALYSIS TO THE TERRITORY LEVEL SIMILAR TO NUTS 2 REGIONS. THE STUDY CARRIED OUT IN THIS WORK, ENABLES US, ON THE ONE HAND, TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCES EXISTING BETWEEN COUNTRIES FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE SHARE OF THE TERTIARY SECTOR IN TOTAL GROSS VALUE ADDED (GVA) AND FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE USE OF SERVICES BY WHOLE OF THE PRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS.

THE FINNISH MODEL HAS RELATIVELY DETAILED INPUT DATA WITH 150 INDUSTRIES AND 918 PRODUCTS AND THE DATA ON IMPORTS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO A MIXED APPROACH WITH THE HELP OF LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORY DATA. THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL SHOWED THAT THE FINNISH ECONOMY USES IMPORTED MATERIAL RESOURCES AS MUCH AS DOMESTIC RESOURCES. LIFE-CYCLE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS CAUSED BY IMPORTS WERE EQUIVALENT TO 70-80\% OF DOMESTIC EMISSIONS. THE GHG EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN IMPORTS (EMISSIONS ABROAD) AND EXPORTS (EMISSIONS WITHIN FINLAND) WERE OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE. THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE SERVICE SECTOR ACCOUNTED FOR 44\% OF GHG EMISSIONS CAUSED BY THE DOMESTIC FINAL USE OF PRODUCTS. ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS ALSO SHOWED THAT THE INDICATOR OF TOTAL MATERIAL REQUIREMENT (TMR) SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT COMPARISONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IN THE FUTURE, THE AIM IS TO USE THE ENVIMAT MODEL FOR ASSESSING TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY; FOR MONITORING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: FOR PLANNING CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION; AND FOR IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THE ECONOMY AND ASSESSING THEIR IMPACTS.

THE RESULTS OF THE INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS SHOW THAT NET EXPORT OF CO2 EMISSIONS INCREASED QUICKLY FROM 2002 TO 2005 BUT DECREASED FROM 2005 TO 2007. THESE TRENDS ARE DUE TO A REDUCTION IN TOTAL CO2 EMISSION INTENSITY, A DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE, AND SMALL IMPORTS OF EMBODIED CO(2)EMISSIONS. THE RESULTS OF THE SDA DEMONSTRATE THAT TOTAL EXPORT VOLUME WAS THE LARGEST DRIVING FACTOR FOR THE INCREASE IN EMBODIED CO2 EMISSIONS DURING 2002-2007, FOLLOWED BY INTERMEDIATE INPUT STRUCTURE.

WE FIND THAT THE EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF TRADED GOODS AND SERVICES HAVE INCREASED FROM 4.3 GT CO(2) IN 1990 (20\% OF GLOBAL EMISSIONS) TO 7.8 GT CO(2) IN 2008 (26\%). MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE INCREASED THEIR CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS FASTER THAN THEIR TERRITORIAL EMISSIONS, AND NON-ENERGY-INTENSIVE MANUFACTURING HAD A KEY ROLE IN THE EMISSION TRANSFERS. THE NET EMISSION TRANSFERS VIA INTERNATIONAL TRADE FROM DEVELOPING TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES INCREASED FROM 0.4 GT CO(2) IN 1990 TO 1.6 GT CO(2) IN 2008, WHICH EXCEEDS THE KYOTO PROTOCOL EMISSION REDUCTIONS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT INTERNATIONAL TRADE IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN EXPLAINING THE CHANGE IN EMISSIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, FROM BOTH A PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION PERSPECTIVE. WE SUGGEST THAT COUNTRIES MONITOR EMISSION TRANSFERS VIA INTERNATIONAL TRADE, IN ADDITION TO TERRITORIAL EMISSIONS, TO ENSURE PROGRESS TOWARD STABILIZATION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.",""

AS A RESULT, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JAPAN AS A SOURCE OF IRON AND STEEL SCRAPS HAS ALSO INCREASED.(1)) SCRAP RECYCLING, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO SOME PROBLEMS, SUCH AS UNSTABLE SUPPLY CONDITIONS AND CONTAMINATION BY IMPURITIES.(2)) A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASING USE OF ELECTRIC DEVICES, SUCH AS CIRCUIT BOARDS, MOTORS, AND WIRING HARNESSES, IN HIGH-TECH PRODUCTS. THESE ELECTRIC DEVICES/EQUIPMENTS CONTAIN MANY KINDS OF METALS, SUCH AS COPPER, LEAD, AND ZINC, WHICH CAN BECOME A SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF STEEL SCRAP RECOVERED FROM END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES (ELVS) OR HOME APPLIANCES. HERE THE CONTAMINATION OF TRAMP ELEMENTS WAS ANALYZED USING A WASTE INPUT OUTPUT MODEL, CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING POINTS: (1) THE AMOUNT OF FERROUS SCRAP USAGE IN IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION PROCESS, (2) COPPER ELIMINATION FROM ELV SCRAPS, AND (3) CONTAMINATION OF COPPER IN IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTS. THE RESULTS OF SCENARIO ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT COPPER CONTAMINATION IN CRUDE STEEL PRODUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SCRAP FROM ELVS COULD BE REDUCED BY 2 \% BY THE USE OF A MORE RECYCLE-ORIENTED ELV TREATMENT. THE EFFECTS OF COPPER ELIMINATION ON CO2 EMISSION WERE MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR ORDINARY STEEL PRODUCTION THAN SPECIAL STEEL PRODUCTION.",""

EU-15 MEMBER STATES CAN BE CATEGORIZED INTO TWO MAIN GROUPS. THE FIRST INCLUDES THE NORDIC COUNTRIES PLUS GREAT BRITAIN, IRELAND, PORTUGAL, SPAIN, AND GREECE, WHERE SOCIOECONOMIC-RELATED INEQUALITY APPEARS TO BE EXPLAINED MAINLY BY THE STUDENTS' BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS. IN PORTUGAL AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN SPAIN THE HIGH CONTRIBUTION OF SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND IS MAINLY DUE TO THE PREVALENCE OF HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC CONCENTRATION OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. THE SECOND GROUP INCLUDES AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, GERMANY, ITALY, LUXEMBOURG, THE NETHERLANDS, AND FRANCE.

POPULATIONS, COMMUNITIES, ECOSYSTEMS, AND LANDSCAPES) BECAUSE THESE PATTERNS OFTEN REFLECT THE FORCES SHAPING THE SYSTEM'S DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS CONSTRAINING THEIR OPERATION. ONE REASON THESE PATTERNS OF DIRECT CONNECTIONS ARE CRITICAL IS THAT THEY ESTABLISH THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH ELEMENTS INFLUENCE EACH OTHER INDIRECTLY. HERE, WE TESTED A HYPOTHESIZED CONSEQUENCE OF CONNECTIVITY IN ECOSYSTEMS: THE HOMOGENIZATION OF RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS IN FLOW NETWORKS. SPECIFICALLY, WE TESTED THE GENERALITY OF THE SYSTEMS ECOLOGY HYPOTHESIS OF RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION IN 50 EMPIRICALLY DERIVED TROPHIC ECOSYSTEM MODELS REPRESENTING 35 DISTINCT ECOSYSTEMS. WE APPLIED NETWORK ENVIRON ANALYSIS (NEA) TO CALCULATE RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION FOR THESE MODELS, WHERE HOMOGENIZATION IS DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION OF THE DIRECT FLOW INTENSITY MATRIX (CV(G)) TO THE COVARIANCE OF THE INTEGRAL FLOW INTENSITY MATRIX (CV(N)). A RATIO GREATER THAN UNITY INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF HOMOGENIZATION. WE ALSO TESTED THE HYPOTHESES THAT HOMOGENIZATION INCREASES WITH SYSTEM SIZE, CONNECTANCE, AND CYCLING. WE FURTHER EVALUATED THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR RESULTS IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, WE VERIFIED THE CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE INPUT- AND OUTPUT-ORIENTED HOMOGENIZATION VALUES TO ENSURE THAT OUR RESULTS WERE NOT BIASED BY OUR DECISION TO FOCUS ON THE OUTPUT ORIENTATION. SECOND, WE CONDUCTED A MONTE CARLO BASED UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR RESULTS TO +/- 5\% ERROR INTRODUCED INTO THE ORIGINAL FLOW MATRICES FOR EACH MODEL. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION OCCURS UNIVERSALLY IN THE 50 ECOSYSTEM MODELS TESTED, WITH VALUES RANGING FROM 1.04 TO 1.97 AND A MEDIAN OF 1.61. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NETWORK HOMOGENIZATION AND SYSTEM SIZE AND CONNECTANCE, AS THE RESULTS OF THE LINEAR REGRESSIONS ARE INSIGNIFICANT. FURTHER, THERE IS ONLY WEAK SUPPORT FOR THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOMOGENIZATION AND CYCLING. WE CONFIRM THAT OUR RESULTS ARE NOT BIASED BY USING THE OUTPUT-ORIENTED HOMOGENIZATION VALUES INSTEAD OF THE INPUT-ORIENTED VALUES BECAUSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR REGRESSION BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF HOMOGENIZATION (R(2) = 0.38, P < 0.001) AND THE VALUES ARE WELL CORRELATED (S = 8,054, RHO = 0.61, P < 0.001). FINALLY, WE FOUND THAT OUR RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO +/- 5\% ERROR IN THE FLOW MATRICES. THE ERROR IN THE HOMOGENIZATION VALUES WAS LESS THAN THE ERROR INTRODUCED INTO THE MODELS AND RANGED FROM A MINIMUM OF 0.24\% TO A MAXIMUM OF 1.5\% WITH A MEDIAN VALUE OF 0.58\%. THE ERROR DID NOT CHANGE THE QUALITATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE HOMOGENIZATION VALUES. IN CONCLUSION, WE FOUND STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE RESOURCE HOMOGENIZATION HYPOTHESIS IN 50 EMPIRICALLY DERIVED ECOSYSTEM MODELS. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

FIRST, A DOMESTIC MATERIAL CONSUMPTION (DMC) INDICATOR FOR FOSSIL RESOURCES (DMCFOSSIL) IN THE MASS UNIT MILLION TONNES IS CALCULATED. DMCFOSSIL SHOWS THAT BETWEEN 1970 AND 2000 UK FOSSIL RESOURCE CONSUMPTION DECREASED BY 10\%, WHICH SUGGESTS ABSOLUTE DEMATERIALIZATION FOR THIS RESOURCE.

SECOND, AN ALTERNATIVE INDICATOR, RESOURCE CONSUMPTION BY A NATION (RCN) FOR FOSSIL RESOURCES (RCNFOSSIL) WAS CALCULATED, WHICH INCLUDES THE INDIRECT FOSSIL RESOURCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO TRADED GOODS AND IS MEASURED IN MILLION TONNES OF OIL EQUIVALENT. RCNFOSSIL SHOWS THAT BETWEEN 1970 AND 2000 UNITED KINGDOM'S FOSSIL RESOURCE CONSUMPTION INCREASED BY 14\%, WHICH EMPHASIZES THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE IN THE MASS OF FOSSIL RESOURCES DEMANDED, IT HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCREASE IN THE VOLUME OF RESOURCE CONSUMED.

THE THIRD CHAPTER FOCUSES ON THE IMPACT OF GROSS FIXED CAPITAL FORMATION (GFCF) UPON THE OUTPUT. ON THE ONE HAND, THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGES IN VOLUME ARE ESTIMATED (FOR EXAMPLE, DATA ON 2007 ARE RECALCULATED FOR A VARIATION OF +1-5\% IN THE GFCF). ON THE OTHER HAND, THE INFLUENCE OF THE SECTORAL STRUCTURE OF THE INDICATOR IN QUESTION IS QUANTIFIED WITH THE HELP OF THREE DIFFERENT MACROECONOMIC SIMULATIONS.

A CASE STUDY FROM THE WATER INDUSTRY ILLUSTRATES THIS COMPARISON. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A TIERED HYBRID MODEL FOR CALCULATING THE LIFE CYCLE IMPACTS OF A SYSTEM. IN SO DOING, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NOVEL WAY OF OVERCOMING A KEY METHODOLOGICAL ISSUE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS METHOD: AVOIDING DOUBLE COUNTING. WE CALCULATE `SYSTEM INCOMPLETENESS FACTORS' AND USE THESE TO DELETE THE LOWER-ORDER BURDENS IN THE INPUT-OUTPUT INVENTORY ACCORDING TO THE DEPTH OF PRODUCTION TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE PROCESS INVENTORY. WE APPLY THIS METHOD TO A CASE STUDY OF SYDNEY WATER CORPORATION. THE FUNCTIONAL UNIT IS THE PROVISION OF WATER AND SEWERAGE SERVICES TO RESIDENTIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN THE CITY OF SYDNEY IN THE YEAR 2002/03. WE ANALYSED THE CASE STUDY USING THREE METHODS: PROCESS ANALYSIS, INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, AND HYBRID ANALYSIS. IN EACH CASE, WE OBTAINED RESULTS FOR EIGHT IMPACT CATEGORIES: WATER USE; PRIMARY ENERGY USE; GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL; CARCINOGENIC AND NON-CARCINOGENIC HUMAN TOXICITY POTENTIALS; AND TERRESTRIAL, MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOTOXICITY POTENTIALS. ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS ANALYSIS HAS A RELATIVELY SHALLOW INVESTIGATIVE DEPTH, IT SHOWS GOOD SYSTEM COVERAGE (I.E. A SMALL TRUNCATION ERROR) FOR MOST INDICATORS. THE TRUNCATION ERRORS FOR ALL OF THE INDICATORS EXCEPT MARINE AQUATIC ECOTOXICITY POTENTIAL COMPARE FAVOURABLY WITH PREDICTED TRUNCATION ERRORS FOR THE RELEVANT INDUSTRY SECTOR. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE TRUNCATION ERROR OF A PARTICULAR PROCESS ANALYSIS CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED USING GENERIC SYSTEM COMPLETENESS CURVES, AND IMPLIES THAT THE TRUNCATION ERROR OF A TYPICAL PROCESS ANALYSIS MAY BE LESS SEVERE THAN IS COMMONLY GENERALISED BY THE PROPONENTS OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. THE CASE STUDY SUPPORTS THE LARGELY THEORETICAL CLAIMS IN THE LITERATURE ABOUT THE RELATIVE MERITS AND DRAWBACKS OF PROCESS AND INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS.

AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING IS THE CONSUMER APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTS FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION, WHEREVER THESE PRESSURES OCCUR. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SUCH AN APPROACH, IN WHICH CO(2) OR GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS ARE CONSIDERED FROM A CONSUMER'S PERSPECTIVE. THE CONSUMER APPROACH MAY OFFER NEW WAYS FOR POLICIES TO REDUCE PRESSURES, AND THEREFORE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO ADOPT THIS PERSPECTIVE IN NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY-MAKING AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS. TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE APPROACHES, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE CONCEPTS OF BOTH, SHOWING THE RESULTS OF AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND GOING INTO THE APPLICATION OF THE TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN (INTERNATIONAL) ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES.

IN THE FIRST TWO SCENARIOS, THE REDUCTION IN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR OUTPUT IS ALLOCATED UNIFORMLY ACROSS SECTORS WHILE IT IS ALLOCATED TO THE 12 LARGEST EMITTING INDUSTRIES IN THE LAST ONE. THE ESTIMATED IMPACTS INDICATE THAT THE RESULTS VARY WITH THE DIFFERENT ALLOCATION METHODS. THE THIRD POLICY SCENARIO, ALLOCATION TO THE 12 LARGEST EMITTING SECTORS, IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE OF THE THREE AS THE IMPACTS OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL REDUCES GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY 3.1\% COMPARED TO 24\% AND 8.1\% IN THE FIRST TWO SCENARIOS. COMPUTED ECONOMIC COSTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS UPPER-BOUNDS BECAUSE THE MODEL ASSUMES IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENT TO THE KYOTO PROTOCOL AND BECAUSE FLEXIBILITY MECHANISMS ARE NOT INCORPORATED. THE RESULTING UPPER-BOUND IMPACT OF THE THIRD SCENARIO MAY SEEM TO CONTRADICT THOSE WHO CLAIM THAT THE KYOTO PROTOCOL WOULD PLACE AN UNBEARABLE BURDEN ON THE CANADIAN ECONOMY. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER B.V.

THE RISK ASSESSMENT IN THIS STUDY IS EVALUATED BASED ON THE MASS OF CHEMICAL RELEASED, ESTIMATED CONCENTRATIONS, EXPOSURE, AND CHEMICAL TOXICITY. METHODS THE RELATIVE RISK FROM TEN ECONOMIC SECTORS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE EIO-LCA MODEL, 55 CHEMICALS UTILIZED IN THOSE SECTORS AND DECABDE ALONG WITH FOUR POTENTIAL DECABDE BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS, WERE EVALUATED FOR THE LIFE CYCLE STAGES AND EXPOSURE PATHWAYS. THE RELATIVE RISK (EXPRESSED AS TOLUENE EQUIVALENTS) OF THE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS, SECTORS, AND LIFE CYCLE STAGES WERE COMPARED TO ASSESS THOSE REPRESENTING THE GREATEST OVERALL RELATIVE RISKS TO HUMANS (VIA INHALATION AND INGESTION) AND FISH. RESULTS THE GREATEST OVERALL RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH RESULTED FROM THE MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION STAGES. FOR FISH, THE MANUFACTURING STAGE REPRESENTED VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE RISK. OF THE 56 CHEMICALS EVALUATED, DECABDE REPRESENTED THE MAJORITY OF THE TOTAL RISK TO HUMANS. HOWEVER, DECABDE POSED THE LEAST RISK COMPARED TO ITS POTENTIAL BREAKDOWN PRODUCTS. DISCUSSION THE RISK TO HUMANS FROM INGESTION, WHICH REPRESENTED THE GREATEST RISK, FROM THE PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURING, AND CONSUMPTION STAGES CAN BE CONTROLLED AND REDUCED THROUGH VARIOUS SAFETY PRECAUTIONS IN THE WORKPLACE.

RECENTLY, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF REGIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE MAIN ISSUE, WHEN APPLYING LCA TO REGION-BASED STUDIES, IS HOW BEST TO CONSIDER AND REFLECT THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, AS THEY NEED TO BE AS CLOSE TO REALITY AS POSSIBLE. SEVERAL LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY (LCI) ANALYSIS AND LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT (LCIA) STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO STUDY SITE-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS. HOWEVER, DUE TO PRACTICALITIES, VERY FEW ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE AT IDENTIFYING THE REGIONS AFFECTED BY REGIONAL ACTIVITIES AND CONSIDER THEIR REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO SUGGEST THE DIRECTION OF A FORTHCOMING STUDY BY SHOWING THE NECESSITY OF REGIONAL CHARACTERISTIC CONSIDERATION IN REGIONAL EVALUATION, AND TO SUGGEST A SYNTHETIC, REGION-BASED LCA METHOD WHICH CAN REFLECT THE DIFFERENCES OF REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF REGIONAL ACTIVITIES. METHODS. IN THIS STUDY, THE LIFE CYCLE REGION-SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT METHOD (LCRAM) WAS PROPOSED AS A NEW SITE-SPECIFIC LCA METHOD. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE USED LCRAM TO OBSERVE THE EFFECTS OF 4 ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS (CO2, NOX, SOX, AND SPM) TO HUMAN HEALTH (DALY) IN 47 REGIONS (PREFECTURES IN JAPAN). LCRAM CONSISTS OF A REGIONAL DATABASE AND AN ANALYSIS METHOD (EIOM). IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING STRUCTURAL (REGIONAL PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION, INTERREGIONAL TRADE, AND THE STRUCTURE OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION) AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES (GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION, CLIMATE, NATURAL CONDITIONS, AND POPULATION DENSITY), WE FIRST CONSTRUCTED A REGIONAL DATABASE. THIS INCLUDES AN INTERREGIONAL TRADE MATRIX (ITM), REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN COEFFICIENTS (REBC), AND REGIONAL DAMAGE FACTORS (RDF). SECOND, FOR CONSIDERING THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS BY USING THE REGIONAL DATABASE TO THE EACH REGION, IT IS A NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN EMITTING REGIONS (EMITTING REGIONS) OF INDIRECT EFFECTS DUE TO REGIONAL ACTIVITY. TO DO THIS, WE DEVELOPED THE EXPANDED INTERREGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT METHOD (EIOM) TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT METHOD (MULTI-REGIONAL IO) BY APPLYING THE TWO-REGIONAL IO METHOD AND THE ITM. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO APPLY MULTI-REGIONAL IO TO MANY REGIONS AND INDUSTRIES OWING TO PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. UPON COMPARISON BETWEEN THE REGIONAL DATABASE, IT WAS FOUND TO SHOW CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES DUE TO REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY HOW MUCH THE DIFFERENCE OF REBC INFLUENCES THE EVALUATION RESULTS BY CALCULATING THE DEVIATION EFFECT INDEX WITH REBC AND, THUS, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE EFFECTS FROM THE IRON AND STEEL, AND ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRIES WERE MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES. ALSO THE SIZE OF RDF VARIES ACCORDING TO THE PROPERTY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN (EB) AND REGION; AND THE MORE SITE-SPECIFIC EB, SUCH AS SPM IN THIS STUDY SHOWS, THE MORE DISTINCT THE DIFFERENCE.,THEREFORE, IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO RECOMMEND THAT THE PROPER REGIONAL DATABASE IS APPLIED TO THE EMITTING REGIONS. MEANWHILE, A COMPARISON WITH A 9-REGION IO TABLE (A MULTI-REGIONAL IO TABLE MADE BY THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, TRADE AND INDUSTRY IN JAPAN) WAS PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE RELIABILITY OF EIOM. THE RESULTS INDICATED A HIGH CONSISTENCY OF OVER 95\%, WHICH VERIFIES THAT EIOM CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF A MULTI-REGIONAL IO METHOD. FINALLY, AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN LCRAM AND REGION-GENERIC METHOD (RGM) FOR NINE ACTIVITY REGIONS, WE CONFIRMED THAT THE RESULTS PRODUCED BY RGM MAY BE AN UNDERESTIMATION OR OVERESTIMATION; AS AN EXAMPLE, THE LARGEST DIFFERENCE AMONG THE REGIONS FOR DALY REACHED 48\% OF THE RGM RESULT. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK. IN THIS STUDY, IT WAS CLEARLY SHOWN THAT THE EVALUATION RESULTS WILL BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE STRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES OF EACH REGION. IT IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE PROPER REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS TO EVALUATE THE ACTUAL REGIONAL ACTIVITY. LCRAM IS AN EFFICIENT METHOD TO CONSIDER THE REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS FOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS TO REGIONS, THROUGH ALL STAGES OF THE ACTIVITIES. ALSO, IT IS POSSIBLE TO APPLY A REGIONAL EVALUATION FOR MORE REGIONS AND MORE DETAIL IN THE INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION. FURTHERMORE, IT DISCUSSES THE INTERDEPENDENCE AND TRANSPORTATION EFFECTS DUE TO INTERACTION BETWEEN THE REGIONS. THUS, IT MAY ENABLE US TO MAKE AN APPROPRIATE DECISION IN REGION-BASED EVALUATIONS SUCH AS NOURISHMENT AND INDUCEMENT OF INDUSTRY, INFRASTRUCTURE, RECYCLE SYSTEM, ETC. FINALLY, IT IS ALSO EXPECTED THAT FURTHER DISCUSSION AND CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ENABLING US TO FRAME AN ACTUAL AND EFFICIENT POLICY BASED ON THE REGIONAL STRUCTURAL FEATURES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES FOR A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY.",""

LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODELS TYPICALLY USE PRODUCT-SPECIFIC, PLANT-LEVEL OR NATIONAL AGGREGATE DATA. HOWEVER, MANY DECISIONS BY REGIONAL POLICY MAKERS WOULD BE BETTER INFORMED BY LOCAL OR REGIONAL AGGREGATE DATA. THIS RESEARCH IS INTENDED TO CONSTRUCT AND APPLY A REGIONAL US ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (REIO-LCA) MODEL BASED UPON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASETS. THE MODEL USES GROSS STATE PRODUCT (GSP) ESTIMATES TO CALCULATE REGIONAL ECONOMIC MULTIPLIERS AND THEN LINK THEM TO REGIONAL ELECTRICITY AND FUEL USE, AND AIR EMISSION FACTORS. TARGET AUDIENCES ARE GOVERNMENTAL DECISION MAKERS, INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND RESEARCHERS CONCERNED,WITH THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DECISIONS. METHODS. A REGIONAL VERSION OF THE EXISTING US EIO-LCA MODEL WAS DEVELOPED USING-REGIONAL ECONOMIC MULTIPLIERS AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA. THE NATIONAL MODEL IS BASED ON THE US 491 BY 491 ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL, AND USES SECTORAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSION FACTORS TO APPROXIMATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF PRODUCTION AND SERVICES. THE PROPORTION OF THE REGIONAL VALUE ADDED (GROSS STATE PRODUCT) TO THE NATIONAL VALUE ADDED FOR EACH SECTOR WAS USED TO DEVELOP ECONOMIC MULTIPLIERS TO ALLOCATE THE OUTPUT OF INDUSTRIES TO INDIVIDUAL STATES AND MULTI-STATE REGIONS. INTER-SECTORAL TRANSACTION MATRICES WERE CONSTRUCTED FOR EIGHT REGIONS. REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSION AND RESOURCE USE FACTORS WERE FORMED BASED UPON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA OF THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) AND DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. THE TOXICS RELEASE INVENTORY INCLUDE FACILITY LOCATION PARAMETERS, ENABLING THE ESTIMATION OF SECTORAL TOXIC EMISSIONS FOR THE REGIONS. THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY AND FUEL USE, AIR POLLUTANTS (CO, NOX, PM10, SO2 AND VOC) AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS USED BY THE EIO-LCA MODEL WERE PROPORTIONED BASED UPON STATE TOTALS FOR EACH SECTOR. RESULTS. A REGIONAL ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL WAS CREATED FOR US REGIONS; AND SECTORAL ENERGY USE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSION FACTORS WERE ESTIMATED FOR PENNSYLVANIA, THE FAR WEST (ALASKA, CALIFORNIA, HAWAII, NEVADA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON) AND THE MIDEAST (DELAWARE, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MARYLAND, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA) ECONOMIC AREAS. THE USE OF THE FRAMEWORK FOR REGIONAL IO-LCA MODEL IS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH TWO CASE STUDIES. DISCUSSION. AS A VALIDATION EXERCISE, THE REGIONAL OUTPUTS OF PETROLEUM REFINERIES WERE CALCULATED USING THE REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MATRICES AND THE OUTCOMES WERE COMPARED TO THE ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION'S (EIA) PETROLEUM STATE PROFILE DATA. THE MODEL RESULTS SHOW THAT APPROXIMATELY 70\% OF THE TOTAL NATIONAL SECTORAL PRODUCTION TAKES PLACE IN THREE REGIONS, I.E., SOUTH WEST, SOUTH EAST AND FAR WEST, WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THE EIA STATISTICS. THE REIO-LCA MODEL CONSTRUCTED FOR THE FAR WEST IS USED TO CONDUCT A SECOND CASE STUDY ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL TOXIC AIR EMISSIONS OF POWER PLANTS IN THE REGION IN 2003. THE RESULTS ARE EVALUATED BY COMPARISON TO DATA PROVIDED BY THE US EPA. THE ESTIMATED POLLUTIONS DO NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE PRESENTED IN THE TOXICS RELEASE INVENTORY REPORTS. CONCLUSIONS. THE USEFULNESS OF IO LCA MODELS CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF LOCAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS. WIHT THE LACK OF US REGIONAL SECTORAL DATA, THE ALLOCATION OF NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION TO REGIONS CAN PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO CREATE SMALLER SCALE IO MODELS. THE RESULTS OF CASE STUDIES SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE GSP MULTIPLIERS MAY BE USED TO ALLOCATE THE SECTORAL PRODUCTION TO THE REGIONS, AND SHOW THAT THE FRAMEWORK IO LCA MODEL PROVIDES A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS CAUSED BY PRODUCTION AND SERVICES. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES. THE QUALITY OF DATA, E.G., AGE AND LEVEL OF AGGREGATION, AND THE ASSUMED LINEARITY BETWEEN SECTORAL OUTPUTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS REPRESENT THE MAIN SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GSP ESTIMATES ARE APPROPRIATE TO CONSTRUCT A FRAMEWORK FOR A REGIONAL ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT MODEL. HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH IS RECOMMENDED TO CONSTRUCT MORE SPECIFIC STATE-LEVEL INPUT-OUTPUT MATRICES INCORPORATING INTERSTATE COMMODITY FLOWS, AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE PARAMETER UNCERTAINTIES. FURTHER, THE MODEL MIGHT BE IMPROVED BY UPDATING IT REGULARLY, AS MORE RECENT DATA BECOME AVAILABLE.",""

AS LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IOA) SYSTEMS INCREASE IN SIZE, COMPUTATION TIMES AND MEMORY USAGE CAN INCREASE RAPIDLY. THE USE OF EFFICIENT METHODS OF SOLUTION ALLOWS THE USE OF A WIDE RANGE OF ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. SOME TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS MONTE-CARLO ANALYSIS, MAY BE LIMITED IF COMPUTATIONAL TIMES ARE TOO SLOW. DISCUSSION OF METHODS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I DESCRIBE ALGORITHMS THAT SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE COMPUTATION TIMES AND MEMORY USAGE FOR SOLVING LCA AND IOA SYSTEMS AND PERFORMING MONTE-CARLO ANALYSIS.

THE ALGORITHMS ARE FURTHER ENHANCED BY USING SPARSE MATRIX ALGEBRA. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. THE ALGORITHMS PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE REDUCE COMPUTATIONAL TIME AND MEMORY USAGE BY ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, WHILE STILL RETAINING A HIGH DEGREE OF ACCURACY. FOR A 3225 X 3225 LCA SYSTEM, THE ALGORITHM REDUCED COMPUTATION TIME FROM 70S TO 0.06S WHILE RETAINING AN ACCURACY OF 10(-3)\%. STORAGE WAS REDUCED FROM 166 MEGABYTES TO 1.8 MEGABYTES.

A FRAMEWORK IS DEVELOPED TO DECOMPOSE THE TOTAL ECONOMY-WIDE CHANGE IN THE EMISSION OF A POLLUTANT INTO FOUR MAJOR COMPONENTS, I.E., STRUCTURAL CHANGE-, FUEL MIX-, FINAL DEMAND-AND JOINT-EFFECTS. THE FINAL DEMAND EFFECT IS FURTHER DECOMPOSED INTO THREE CATEGORIES, I.E., CONSTRUCTION OF POWER PLANTS, ELECTRICITY FINAL DEMAND AND FINAL DEMAND RELATED TO ELECTRICITY USING EQUIPMENTS. THE FACTOR DECOMPOSITION FRAMEWORK IS THEN APPLIED IN THE CASE OF THE POWER SECTOR IN INDONESIA. A KEY FINDING IN THE CASE OF INDONESIA IS THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF THE RE, THERE WOULD BE TOTAL ECONOMY-WIDE REDUCTIONS IN CO2, SO2, AND NOX EMISSIONS OF 431, 1.6 AND 1.3 MILLION TONS RESPECTIVELY DURING THE PLANNING HORIZON OF 2006-2025 UNDER IRP AS COMPARED TO THAT UNDER TEP.

THE TOP TEN ENVIRONMENTALLY MOST IMPORTANT PRODUCT GROUPS (OUT OF 138 INDUSTRY PRODUCTS AND 98 FINAL CONSUMPTION GROUPS) ARE LISTED FOR EACH OF THE THREE PERSPECTIVES, USING BOTH TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INTENSITY AS RANKING PRINCIPLES. THE STUDY COVERS ALL SUBSTANCES THAT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES OF GLOBAL WARMING, OZONE DEPLETION, ACIDIFICATION, NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT, PHOTOCHEMICAL OZONE FORMATION, ECOTOXICITY HUMAN TOXICITY, AND NATURE OCCUPATION. THE DIFFERENCES IN RESULTS BETWEEN THE THREE PERSPECTIVES ARE ELABORATED AND THEIR POLICY RELEVANCE DISCUSSED. THE TOP TEN PRODUCT GROUPS ACCOUNT FOR A SURPRISINGLY LARGE SHARE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF DANISH PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION (UP TO 45\%, DEPENDING UPON THE PERSPECTIVE). THIS IMPLIES THAT PRODUCT-ORIENTED ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY MAY ACHIEVE LARGE IMPROVEMENTS BY FOCUSING ON A RATHER SMALL NUMBER OF PRODUCT GROUPS. BOTH IMPORTED PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS PRODUCED FOR EXPORT IN GENERAL CAUSE MORE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAN PRODUCTS PRODUCED IN DENMARK FOR THE DANISH MARKET. ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE ARE THE EXPORT OF MEAT AND SHIP TRANSPORT. THIS LEADS TO THE RECOMMENDATION TO INCLUDE SPECIFIC POLICY MEASURES TARGETING BOTH FOREIGN PRODUCERS AND FOREIGN MARKETS. BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVELY LARGE INPUT OF LABOR, PUBLIC CONSUMPTION IS FOUND TO HAVE A MUCH SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT INTENSITY THAN PRIVATE CONSUMPTION.

IN THIS ANALYSIS, WE APPLY OUR MODEL TO THE INSULATION CASE STUDY AND EVALUATE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF INCREASED INSULATION FOR NEW HOUSING. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. THE CENTRAL ESTIMATE OF IMPACTS FROM THE COMPLETE INSULATION MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CHAIN IS APPROXIMATELY 20 PREMATURE DEATHS, 500 ASTHMA ATTACKS, AND 8,000 RESTRICTED ACTIVITY DAYS NATIONWIDE FOR ONE YEAR OF INCREASED FIBERGLASS OUTPUT. OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED INSULATION MANUFACTURING, 83\% ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN EMISSIONS FROM THE MINERAL WOOL INDUSTRY, WHICH IS MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIRECT PRIMARY PM2.5 EMISSIONS FROM THE INDUSTRY (98\%).

IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, WE INTEGRATE FINANCIAL INPUT-OUTPUT TABLES THAT DESCRIBE THE INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN ECONOMIC SECTORS, WITH NATIONAL SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTS TO CONSTRUCT NUMERATE `TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE' ACCOUNTS FOR 135 DISCRETE SECTORS. THE ACCOUNTS ARE PORTRAYED AGAINST THE NUMERAIRE OF `ONE DOLLAR OF GDP'. THUS, FOR A SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY, FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF PERFORMANCE CAN BE EXPRESSED FOR EXAMPLE AS DOLLARS OF EXPORT EARNINGS PER DOLLAR OF GDP. SOCIAL ASPECTS SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT CAN BE PORTRAYED AS MINUTES OF EMPLOYMENT GENERATED PER DOLLAR. GREENHOUSE ISSUES CAN BE PORTRAYED AS KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMITTED PER DOLLAR. SINCE THESE INDICATORS OF `TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE' PERFORMANCE ARE REFERENCED AGAINST FINANCIAL UNITS AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SYSTEM OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, THEY CAN BE APPLIED TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS OF A FIRM, A SERVICE OR A PRODUCT, AND ALLOW A ROBUST TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE ACCOUNT TO BE DEVELOPED ACROSS A RANGE OF SCALES. THE CRITICAL ADVANTAGE OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT IT INCLUDES BOTH THE DIRECT OR IMMEDIATE EFFECTS AS WELL AS THE INDIRECT OR DIFFUSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGE AND DISTANT CHAIN OF SUPPLY PATHS. THE INCORPORATION OF MOST INDIRECT OR UPSTREAM EFFECTS THEREFORE EXPANDS THE RANGE OF ISSUES AND EFFECTS WITHIN THE ANALYTICAL BOUNDARY, AND ALSO INCLUDES IMPORTS AND EXPORTS. BOTH PRODUCTS AND FIRMS CAN THEN BE ASSESSED PROPERLY IN SUSTAINABLE CHAIN MANAGEMENT (SCM) TERMS. THUS, A FIRM THAT USES A KEY INTERMEDIATE INPUT THAT REQUIRES A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER FOR EXAMPLE CANNOT HIDE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS SINCE THEY ARE REVEALED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE FULL PRODUCTION CHAIN. THIS REVELATION CAN ALSO UNDERPIN PROGRESS WHEN FIRMS ACKNOWLEDGE BOTH THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS, AND IMPROVE THEIR SELECTION OF KEY INPUTS ON A WIDER RANGE OF CRITERIA, RATHER THAN ON PRICE ALONE.

RECYCLING WAS FOUND TO OUTPERFORM THE `TRADITIONAL' TREATMENT METHOD STRATEGY WITH REGARD TO THE REDUCTION OF CO2 EMISSION, LANDFILL CONSUMPTION, AND THE DEMAND FOR ABIOTIC RESOURCES. THANKS TO EFFICIENT UTILIZATION OF THE EXISTING RETAIL NETWORK SYSTEM, IT WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE MORE EFFICIENT ECONOMICALLY. ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF DFD AND THE ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN THE QUALITY OF RECOVERED MATERIALS (PLASTICS) WERE FOUND TO AUGMENT THE POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RECYCLING. THE EPL WITHOUT UPGRADING RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, BUT ALSO IN THE LEVEL OF EMPLOYMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EPL WITH UPGRADING WAS FOUND TO OUTPERFORM THE RECYCLING STRATEGY IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WITHOUT HAVING SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION. RECYCLING OF EL-EHA, AS PRESCRIBED BY THE JAPANESE LAW ON THE RECYCLING OF EL-EHA, WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CO, EMISSION, DEPLETION OF ABIOTIC RESOURCES, GENERATION OF WASTE, AND LANDFILL CONSUMPTION, PROVIDED THE RATE OF RETRIEVAL REMAINS AT A HIGH LEVEL.

THIS CRITICISM IS MORE CONCERNED WITH THE ENERGY FOOTPRINT BECAUSE IT DOMINATES THE ESTIMATED EF IN MANY CASE STUDIES, AND ITS SIZE WOULD CHANGE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WHEN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED. ONE MAIN REASON FOR THIS DEFICIENCY IS THAT THE ORIGINAL CALCULATION METHOD DOES NOT EXPLICITLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LINKAGES AMONG THE FINAL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES, FINAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, AND PRIMARY ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, THESE LINKAGES MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SCENARIOS AND SIMULATION OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS FOR REDUCING ENERGY FOOTPRINTS. THIS PAPER PROPOSES A CALCULATION FRAMEWORK TO INCLUDE THE CONCERNED LINKAGES IN ORDER TO: (1) ESTIMATE ENERGY FOOTPRINTS ACCORDING TO THE PRIMARY ENERGIES EMBODIED IN THE GOODS AND SERVICES CONSUMED BY A DEFINED HUMAN POPULATION, AND (2) DEVELOP SCENARIOS AND SIMULATION OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS FOR REDUCING ENERGY FOOTPRINTS.

PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT, A MAIN COMPONENT OF THE EF, REPRESENTS THE LANDS USED BY PRODUCTION SECTORS FOR PRODUCING THE GOODS AND SERVICES FOR THE FINAL CONSUMPTION OF A GIVEN HUMAN POPULATION. THERE HAVE BEEN, AT LEAST, TWO ALTERNATIVES IN ESTIMATING THE PRODUCTION LAND FOOTPRINT. ONE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATES OF `APPARENT CONSUMPTION' OF EACH TYPE OF RESOURCE, ALONG THE LINE OF THE METHODOLOGY PROPOSED BY WACKERNAGEL AND PEES (WACKERNAGEL, M., PEES, W.E., 1996) AND ITS LATER REFINEMENT. THE OTHER, SUGGESTED BY BICKNELL ET AL. (1998) IS BASED ON THE MONETARY VALUES OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE DELIVERED TO DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND, THE INFORMATION RECORDED IN AN INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE FORMER FACES THE CHALLENGE OF DISTINGUISHING THE COMMODITIES USED AS INTERMEDIATE INPUT FROM THOSE AS FINAL CONSUMPTION. ALTHOUGH ITS RECENT DEVELOPMENT HAS TRIED TO CALCULATE THE RAW MATERIALS USED DIRECTLY IN TRADED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS (WACKERNAGEL, M., LEWAN, L., HANSSON, C.B., 1999A) IT IS NOT AN EASY JOB BECAUSE THE INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED. USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO CONSIDER THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT INPUT REQUIREMENTS OF SUPPORTING FINAL DEMAND, MAY ALLEVIATE THIS DIFFICULTY. BICKNELL ET AL.

THE GLOBAL WARMING PROBLEM CAUSED BY CARBON DIOXIDE IS SERIOUS, BECAUSE ENERGY SUPPLY FOR MODEM INDUSTRY DEPENDS ON THE USAGE OF FOSSIL FUEL. RENEWABLE ENERGY USAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE ONE OF THE KEY TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE THE EMISSION OF CARBON DIOXIDE. ENERGY SYSTEMS, HOWEVER, TO GATHER THE RENEWABLE ENERGIES ARE TEND TO BE LARGE DUE TO THE LOW ENERGY DENSITY, AND REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNT OF INITIAL INPUT ENERGY. THE ASSESSMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO PRODUCE EQUIPMENT AND TO CONSTRUCT RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF SYSTEMS AS ENERGY PRODUCER. IN THIS PAPER, ENERGY INTENSITY IS EVALUATED USING INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE AND SEVERAL TOPICS ON THE USE OF THE TABLE ARE DISCUSSED. THE ESTIMATION OF ENERGY INTENSITY GAVE REASONABLE VALUES FOR JAPANESE INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE OF 1985. IN THE ANALYSIS OF ENERGY INTENSITY USING INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE, THE EVALUATION OF ELECTRICITY HAS SEVERAL ALTERNATIVES. A METHOD IS PROPOSED TO MODIFY THE STRUCTURAL MATRIX TO MANIPULATE ELECTRICITY IN A UNIFIED WAY. THE EFFECT OF FIXED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION IS CONSIDERED, WHICH IS NOT COUNTED IN NORMAL WAY OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT THE CHANGE IN CONSIDERING FIXED CAPITAL IS NOT SO LARGE FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE IN JAPAN.

TO ENABLE THIS ASSESSMENT, IN BARBITURATE-ANESTHETIZED CATS AND URETHANE-ANESTHETIZED RATS JUXTACELLULAR RECORDINGS WERE PERFORMED TOGETHER WITH MICROIONTOPHORETIC EJECTION OF TRANSMITTER AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS. THE EFFECTS OF THESE DRUGS WERE STUDIED ON RESPONSES EVOKED BY MECHANICAL STIMULATION OF CUTANEOUS RECEPTIVE FIELDS (RFS) OF NEURONS IN THE THALAMIC VENTROBASAL COMPLEX (VB). NEURONS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VB WERE INVESTIGATED: 29 UNITS WERE LOCATED MEDIALLY, IN THE VENTRAL POSTEROMEDIAL NUCLEUS (VPM; FACIAL RFS), AND 11 UNITS WERE LOCATED LATERALLY, IN THE VENTRAL POSTEROLATERAL NUCLEUS (VPL; FOREPAW AND BODY RFS). A FURTHER ELEVEN VB UNITS HAD NO DETECTABLE RF. TWENTY-SIX NEURONS WERE TESTED WITH ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX (SI), 17 OF THESE BEING IDENTIFIED AS THALAMO-CORTICAL RELAY NEURONS AND 5 BEING CLASSIFIED AS PRESUMED INTERNEURONS; THE REMAINING 4 COULD NOT BE ACTIVATED. FOUR ADDITIONAL RECORDINGS WERE FROM TRIGEMINO-THALAMIC OR THALAMO-CORTICAL FIBERS. FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE NEURONS' INPUT AND OUTPUT, NEURONAL ACTIVITY WAS INDUCED BY FEEDBACK-CONTROLLED, MECHANICAL TRAPEZOIDAL AND/OR SINUSOIDAL STIMULI APPLIED TO SINUS HAIRS, FUR OR SKIN AND THE NUMBERS OF PREPOTENTIALS AND SOMA SPIKES WERE COMPARED IN PERISTIMULUS TIME HISTOGRAMS (PSTHS) GENERATED SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR BOTH TYPES OF SIGNAL FROM `DC' RECORDINGS. IONTOPHORETIC ADMINISTRATION OF EXCITATORY AMINO ACIDS (EAAS) OR BICUCULLINE METHIODIDE (BMI) INCREASED OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS IN 87\% OF THE CASES TESTED, DUE TO A HIGHER RATE OF CONVERSION OF PREPOTENTIALS INTO SOMA SPIKES TAKING PLACE. IN CASES OF NEURONS EXHIBITING A SUSTAINED-TO-TRANSIENT RESPONSE PATTERN, CHANGES TO SUSTAINED-TO-SUSTAINED PATTERNS WERE DEMONSTRATED. TESTS WITH GAMMAAMINOBUTYRIC ACID (GABA) PRODUCED DECREASED OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS IN 90\% OF THE NEURONS, DUE TO A LOWER CONVERSION RATE OF PREPOTENTIALS INTO SOMA SPIKES TAKING PLACE. IN CASES OF NEURONS EXHIBITING HIGH OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS (SUSTAINED-TO-SUSTAINED TYPE), THE RESPONSES CHANGED TO THE SUSTAINED-TO-TRANSIENT PATTERN. FOR CORTICALLY EVOKED ANTIDROMIC SPIKES OF VB NEURONS, GABA PRODUCED A FAILURE OF THE INITIAL SEGMENT (IS-) SPIKE TO INVADE THE SOMA, WHEREAS BMI AND GLUTAMATE (GLU) FACILITATED SOMA DEPOLARIZATION. WHEN EJECTED WITH RELATIVELY HIGHER CURRENTS THAN THOSE NEEDED TO ALTER OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS, EAAS DECREASED PREPOTENTIAL AMPLITUDES WHILE GABA PRODUCED INCREASES IN 16 OF 18 NEURONS. CONCURRENT ADMINISTRATION OF BOTH TYPES (EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY) OF AMINO ACID YIELDED ENHANCED SOMA SPIKE ACTIVITY DUE TO GLU, CONCOMITANT WITH THE ENLARGED PREPOTENTIAL AMPLITUDE CAUSED BY GABA. TETRODOTOXIN (TTX) REVERSIBLY ABOLISHED SOMA SPIKES IN 9 OF 11 CASES (BUT NOT FIBER SPIKES). EAA ANTAGONISTS EXERTED NO EFFECT UPON OUTPUT-INPUT RATIOS OR UPON SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION. GLU AND BMI BOTH SHORTENED THE CONVERSION TIME BETWEEN PREPOTENTIAL AND SOMA SPIKE AND INCREASED THE SPIKE DISCHARGE RATE. WHEREAS BMI DID SO IN A STIMULUS- AND INPUT-RELATED MANNER, HIGH DOSES OF GLU CAUSED A CONTINUOUS ONGOING DISCHARGE UNTIL ALL SPIKE ACTIVITY STOPPED DUE TO DEPOLARIZATION BLOCK. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE OUTPUT OF THALAMIC VB NEURONS IS CONTROLLED BY GABA-MEDIATED INHIBITORY PROCESSES, LIKELY OPERATING AT THE INITIAL SEGMENT OF THE AXON. THIS HOLDS FOR THALAMO-CORTICAL RELAY NEURONS AND PRESUMED THALAMIC INTERNEURONS. TWO PROCESSES APPEAR TO BE IN ACTION: AN INTRINSIC MECHANISM THAT OPERATES TONICALLY IN VB TO GENERALLY CONSTRAIN THE OUTPUT OF NATURALLY-DRIVEN NEURONS, AND A SECOND MECHANISM THAT INFLUENCES THE STRENGTH OF THIS GABA-MEDIATED INHIBITION, THEREBY GENERATING CHANGES IN THE RESPONSE REPERTOIRE OF THE NEURONS. THIS PROCESS APPEARS TO BE TO A LARGE EXTENT UNDER THE CONTROL OF INPUTS FROM THE NEURONS' PERIPHERAL RECEPTIVE FIELD.",""

SEED YIELDS OF THE NOD ISOLINE IN THE HP REGIME WERE 3700 KG HA-1 IN THE TWO SUMMER SEASONS AND 2400 TO 2500 KG HA-1 IN THE FALL SEASONS, WITH A MEAN INCREASE OF 85\% COMPARED TO YIELDS OF THE NOD P0 CONTROL. NONNOD SEED YIELDS AND N ACCUMULATION WERE UNAFFECTED BY THE P REGIME, AVERAGING 870 AND 48 KG HA-1, RESPECTIVELY.

AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR P REMOVAL AT HARVEST, A NET P INPUT OF JUST 99 KG P HA-1 AFTER FOUR CROPS INCREASED CUMULATIVE SEED YIELD BY 3600 KG HA-1 AND BNF BY 227 KG N HA-1 IN THE LP TREATMENT.

A THREE-PERSPECTIVE ENERGY-CARBON NEXUS MODEL IS DEVELOPED TO FACILITATE COMPREHENSIVE CO2 EMISSION-REDUCTION ANALYSIS IN CHINA. THE MODEL INCORPORATES ENVIRONMENTAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AND ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WITHIN A GENERAL FRAMEWORK TO CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PROVINCES IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTION-BASED, CONSUMPTION-BASED AND INCOME-BASED ACCOUNTINGS. A NEW INDICATOR, INDIRECT EMISSION DOMINANT FACTOR, IS FOR THE FIRST TIME EXAMINED TO EVALUATE THE DOMINANT CAPABILITIES OF INDIRECT EMISSIONS. IT IS DISCOVERED THAT THE EMISSIONS TRIGGERED BY THE DEMAND-SIDE ARE NOT SENSITIVE TO ENERGY TYPES. FURTHERMORE, THE CHANGES OF INTEGRAL FLOW CONTROL INTENSITY IN EACH PROVINCE ARE INSIGNIFICANT FROM CONSUMPTION-BASED AND INCOME-BASED PERSPECTIVES. FINAL DEMAND CONTRIBUTES 80\% OF CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS AND GROSS VALUE-ADDED CREATION LEADS TO A TOTAL OF 82\% INCOME-BASED CO2 EMISSIONS IN CHINA IN 2012. WHEN CONTROLLING EMISSIONS FROM MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES, TRADITIONAL METHODS MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE SINCE THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THE FORMS OF EMISSIONS; SOME METHODS (E.G., PRODUCT ALLOCATION) ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR SUPPRESSING INDIRECT EMISSIONS. MOREOVER, THE PROSPERITY OF DEVELOPED REGIONS (E.G. GUANGDONG) HIGHLY RELY ON SUPPORT FROM UNDERDEVELOPED REGIONS (E.G. INNER MONGOLIA).

STANDARD ACCOUNTING OF EMISSIONS COUNTS THE `TERRITORIAL' EMISSIONS THAT OCCUR WITHIN A COUNTRY, BUT THERE HAS ALSO BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED FOR `CONSUMPTION-BASED' CARBON ACCOUNTING (CBCA) THAT COUNTS THE CARBON EMISSIONS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE GOODS AND SERVICES CONSUMED IN A COUNTRY (IN SHORT: THE COUNTRY CARBON FOOTPRINT (CCF)). GLOBAL MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (GMRIO) DATABASES FORM THE METHOD OF CHOICE TO CALCULATE CARBON FOOTPRINTS. DUE TO THE NEED TO COMBINE DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES TO CONSTRUCT GMRIOS, AND INCOMPLETENESS AND INCONSISTENCIES IN DATA SOURCES, ESTIMATIONS AND BALANCING PROCEDURES HAVE TO BE APPLIED. SUCH CONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES ARE NOT UNIFORM. THIS LEADS TO HESITATION OVER USING CCF RESULTS IN POLICY FORMULATION. THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER SYNTHESIZES THE FEW SIMPLE MEASURES THAT CAN ALREADY LEAD TO ROBUST CCF RESULTS, EVEN WITH DIFFERENT GMRIO MODELS. THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT POINT IS TO USE HARMONIZED TERRITORIAL CARBON EMISSIONS IN DIFFERENT GMRIO MODELS.

SPECIFICALLY, DIFFERENT POWER GENERATION TYPES ARE CONSIDERED TO QUANTIFY THE INTER-PROVINCIAL TRANSFERS OF CO2 EMBODIED IN ELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS IS USED TO DESCRIBE THE INTEGRAL MUTUAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PROVINCES AND DISTINGUISH THE CONTROL INTENSITY OF EACH PROVINCE FROM DIFFERENT CO2 FLOWS DIRECTIONS. FIVE NEW ENERGY-CARBON EMISSION FACTORS ARE FIRST PERFORMED TO PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROVINCE'S EMISSIONS CAPACITY FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. BASED ON THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF ENERGY-CARBON NEXUS, THE EMISSION REDUCTION SIMULATIONS CONSIDERING ENERGY SUBSTITUTION POLICY CAN BE CONDUCTED TO FORECAST THE CHANGES OF PROVINCIAL RESPONSIBILITY UNDER DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS SHOW THAT SOME PROVINCES (E.G., BEIJING) DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE SUPPLY OF OTHER PROVINCES BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATE IN ELECTRICITY, WHILE SOME PROVINCES (E.G., GUANGDONG) HAVE HIGH SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATE AND STILL EMIT MORE CO2 TO OTHER PROVINCES TO PROMOTE THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPORTANCE OF EAST CHINA TO THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE IGNORED, BUT IT SHOULD ALSO UNDERTAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT IN SHANDONG WILL SLOW DOWN BECAUSE IT MAINLY RELIES ON COAL POWER GENERATION TO INDIRECTLY PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER PROVINCES.

IN VIEW OF THIS, USING THE DEPOSIT AND LOAN OF ENERGY CAPITAL, AND ENERGY EXPORTATION INTO CONSIDERATION, WE EMPLOYED AN ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL AND INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURAL CARBON EMISSIONS FROM ENERGY SYSTEMS ON THE ENERGY SUPPLY-SIDE AND FROM CHINESE INDUSTRIES ON THE ENERGY DEMAND-SIDE DURING 2002-2015. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ON THE SUPPLY-SIDE, THE CHINA'S MAJORIZATION IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE WOULD RESULT IN A DECLINE OF PROPORTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM HIGH-CARBON ENERGY (RAW COAL, DIESEL OIL, COMBUSTION OIL, ETC.) AND A RISE IN PROPORTION OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM LOW-CARBON ENERGY (NATURAL GAS, OTHER GAS, ETC.) IN ENERGY SYSTEMS. MOREOVER, THE STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION OF LOW-CARBON ENERGY WAS GENERALLY MORE ROBUST THAN THAT OF HIGH-CARBON ENERGY, AND 2012-2015 WAS THE OPTIMAL PERIOD FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE IN THE STUDY INTERVAL. ON THE DEMAND-SIDE, INTERMEDIATE USE (ENTERPRISES) WAS STILL THE DRIVING FACTOR FOR ENERGY CARBON EMISSIONS, ALTHOUGH END-USERS (RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT) HAD A LIMITED DRIVING EFFECT ON ENERGY CARBON EMISSIONS. SPECIFICALLY, FOR INDUSTRIES WITH INTERMEDIATE USE OF ENERGY, THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LIGHT INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, CONSTRUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, THE SERVICE INDUSTRY, AND THE POWER SECTOR TO CARBON EMISSIONS EXHIBITED A DOWNWARD, FLUCTUATING TREND; THE USE OF ENERGY BY HEAVY INDUSTRY BARELY CHANGED, AND THE USE OF ENERGY BY THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AND FOSSIL ENERGY SECTOR SHOWED A RISING, FLUCTUATING TREND. THESE DATA SUGGESTED THAT THE CHANGE IN INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURE WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO CARBON EMISSIONS FROM USE OF ENERGY.

A KEY ELEMENT OF SYSTEM INCOMPLETENESS IS THE TREATMENT OF SERVICES AND CAPITAL, WHICH ARE, RESPECTIVELY, OFTEN MISREPRESENTED IN LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA, DUE TO BEING LARGELY MISSING IN PROCESS-BASED DATABASES) AND INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IOA, DUE TO BEING EXOGENOUS TO THE INTERMEDIATE USES).

USING A GLOBAL MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE EVOLUTION OF CH4 EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND FINAL CONSUMPTION IN MAJOR ECONOMIES DURING 2000-2012. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CHINA, THE EU, USA, INDIA AND BRAZIL WERE THE TOP FIVE ECONOMIES WITH HIGH VOLUMES OF CONSUMPTION-BASED CH4 EMISSIONS FROM 2000 TO 2012. IN PARTICULAR, CHINA'S CONSUMPTION-BASED CH4 EMISSIONS SHOWED AN OBSERVABLE GROWTH TREND, WHILE THE EU, THE USA AND JAPAN SHOWED A DOWNWARD TREND. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT GROWING AMOUNTS OF CH4 EMISSIONS (I.E., THE VOLUME INCREASE FROM 77.1 MT IN 2000 TO 95.9 MT IN 2012) WERE TRANSFERRED GLOBALLY VIA INTERNATIONAL TRADE, PRIMARILY AS EXPORTS FROM CHINA, RUSSIA AND OTHER LARGE DEVELOPING ECONOMIES TO CONSUMERS IN MAJOR DEVELOPED ECONOMIES.

TAKING BOTH A PRODUCER AND A CONSUMER-BASED PERSPECTIVE, SECTORS ARE ANALYSED AND CATEGORISED THROUGH VARIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS. THE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH DISCERNS BETWEEN EMISSION INVENTORIES OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES AND EMBODIED EMISSIONS OF CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, THUS ASSIGNING A DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITIES. FURTHER, AN INNOVATIVE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMISATION MODEL IS DEVELOPED WITH CONSIDERATION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP), GHG EMISSIONS, AND EMPLOYMENT. THIS METHODOLOGY ENABLES MAPPING AN OPTIMISED SPACE OF SCENARIOS FOR EMISSION REDUCTION THROUGH CONSUMPTION LIMITATION WITH A MINIMAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC LOSS. THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY WAS USED AS A CASE STUDY. RESULTS SHOW A SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE ALLOCATION OF EMISSIONS FROM A PRODUCER AND A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE, INDICATING THAT MANY SECTORS RELY ON A SMALL NUMBER OF EMISSIONS-INTENSIVE SECTORS FOR THEIR ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THE OPTIMISATION, ALL POSSIBLE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE LINKED TO CONSUMPTION LIMIT SCENARIOS OF MINIMISED ECONOMIC AND EMPLOYMENT LOSSES. THE MODEL IS EFFECTIVE IN SHOWING AREAS OF INTEREST FOR FURTHER SCRUTINY IN CONSUMPTION MODIFICATION TO MEET A NATIONAL AGENDA. ADDITIONALLY, BECAUSE OF ITS ADJUSTABLE AND SCALABLE CONFIGURATION, THE MODEL CAN SERVE AS THE BASIS FOR FUTURE TAILORED ANALYSIS INVOLVING SIMULTANEOUS MULTIPLE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

NATION-SECTORS WITH THE LARGEST VWSR IMPORTS ARE ALSO IDENTIFIED UNDER THE TWO CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING FOOD \& BEVERAGES SECTORS, TEXTILES AND WEARING APPAREL SECTORS, AND PETROLEUM, CHEMICAL AND NON-METALLIC MINERAL PRODUCTS SECTORS IN SAUDI ARABIA, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RUSSIA, GERMANY, ITALY, AND CHINA. THESE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE NATION-SECTORS FACING THE REDUCTION IN FOREIGN WATER RESOURCES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH COMPARING THE CHANGE OF RANKINGS OF VWSR IMPORTS, VWSR EXPORTS, AND LWSRS AT COUNTRY AND SECTOR LEVEL, THE RANKINGS OF VWSR EXPORTS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO LWSRS, WHILE THE RANKINGS OF VWSR IMPORTS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM LWSRS. THE EVALUATION DEMONSTRATES THAT NATIONS SHOULD COOPERATIVELY MANAGE WATER RESOURCES AND BE AWARE OF THE TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUAL WATER SCARCITY RISK THROUGH INTERNATIONAL TRADE UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. MOREOVER, NATION-SECTORS WITH HIGH VWSR IMPORTS MAY REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON WATER-INTENSIVE PRODUCTS AND DIVERSIFY IMPORTING SOURCES, AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO CHANGE CONSUMPTION PATTERNS.

AT PRESENT, EMPIRICAL STUDIES ASSESSING SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS OF AVIATION BIOFUEL ARE RARE IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, IS TO ASSESS KEY EFFECTS OF AVIATION BIOFUEL PRODUCTION ON EMPLOYMENT, GDP, AND TRADE BALANCE. A SCENARIOS-BASED INPUT-OUTPUT (IO) ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE THESE SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS, TAKING BRAZILIAN AVIATION BIOFUEL PRODUCTION TO 2050 AS AN EXAMPLE. TO ADDRESS THE UNCERTAINTY OF IO ANALYSIS, WE HAVE PROPOSED A STOCHASTIC SIMULATION APPROACH FOR THE TECHNICAL COEFFICIENTS IN THE IO MODEL. FOUR DISTINCT SCENARIOS WERE DEVELOPED. IN EACH, THREE POTENTIAL COMBINATIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES AND FEEDSTOCKS FOR PRODUCING AVIATION BIOFUEL WERE EVALUATED: SUGARCANE VIA ALCOHOL TO JET (ATJ), MACAUBA VIA HYDRO-PROCESSED ESTERS AND FATTY ACIDS (HEFA), AND EUCALYPTUS VIA FISCHER-TROPSCH (FT). AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE FOUND THAT THE PRODUCTION OF AVIATION BIOFUEL WOULD CREATE AROUND 12,000-65,000 JOBS, WHILE CONTRIBUTING US\$200-1100 MILLION TO BRAZIL'S GDP UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT SUPPLY CHAINS. THE SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS CALCULATED DETERMINISTICALLY WERE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN THE STOCHASTIC OUTCOMES, WHICH CAN BE EXPLAINED BY FACTORS SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL LEARNING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. AVIATION BIOFUEL PRODUCTION SHOWED LARGE POSITIVE NET SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND GDP, ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE FOSSIL SECTORS WOULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. OVERALL, THE MACAUBA-HEFA CHAIN (WITH THE HIGHEST EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT AND GDP, AND THE LOWEST EFFECTS ON IMPORTS) SEEMED TO BE THE MOST FAVORABLE OF THE SCENARIOS STUDIED, DESPITE THE RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

EXCEPT FOR THE ``AGRICULTURE, HUNTING, FORESTRY AND FISHING'' SECTOR, THE INDUSTRIAL SECTORS WITH THE LARGEST GWFC WERE ``FOOD, BEVERAGES AND TOBACCO'' ``CONSTRUCTION'' ``CHEMICALS AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS'' AND ``TEXTILES AND TEXTILE PRODUCTS''. THE BRIC COUNTRIES (BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA) HAD A LARGER GWFP THAN THEIR GWFC, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR OVER HALF OF GLOBAL GWFP (53.6\%), AND THEIR GWFP WAS MAINLY GENERATED FROM THE PRODUCTION OF DOMESTIC FINAL DEMAND. IN CONTRAST, THE OECD29 AND EU27 GROUPS OF COUNTRIES I.E. THE COUNTRY GROUPS CONSISTING MAINLY OF ECONOMICALLY ADVANCED NATIONS, HAD LARGER GWFC THAN THEIR GWFP. OVERALL, THE OECD29 AND EU27 OUTSOURCED 134.8 KM(3) AND 64.4 KM(3) OF THEIR GREY WATER RESPECTIVELY, MOSTLY TO LARGE NEWLY ADVANCED ECONOMIES SUCH AS THE BRIC GROUP OF COUNTRIES, WHICH, IN TURN, WERE COLLECTIVELY OUTSOURCING 112 KM(3) OF GREY WATER.

AIM: THE FINAL AND INTERMEDIATE TRADE FLOWS BETWEEN REGIONS OF KWAZULU-NATAL, SOUTH AFRICA, ARE INVESTIGATED IN THIS ARTICLE. SETTING: THE FIVE MAJOR REGIONS OF KWAZULU-NATAL PROVINCE. METHODS: TO INVESTIGATE THESE SPATIAL LINKAGES, A MODIFIED MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL WAS CONSTRUCTED. A SURVEY APPROACH WAS USED TO CONSTRUCT THE MODEL AND INVOLVED PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED THROUGH A SPECIALLY DESIGNED SURVEY. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT RICHARDS BAY AND DURBAN HAD THE HIGHEST OUTPUT MULTIPLIERS, LEADING TO THE LARGEST EFFECT ON OUTPUT AND TRADE FLOWS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE VALUES OF INTRA TRADE OF THESE REGIONS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE TRADE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS URBAN REGIONS. DURBAN HAS A FAIRLY OPEN ECONOMY, TRADING SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE OTHER FOUR REGIONS, FOLLOWED BY PIETERMARITZBURG AND RICHARDS BAY.

THE RESULTS SHOW HOW THE INTERVENTION PRODUCES POSITIVE NET EFFECTS ON THE PRIMARY ENERGY BALANCE OF THE ENERGY SECTOR ONLY WHEN SUSTAINED BY ADEQUATE SHARES OF RENEWABLES, AS IN THE SEN (-1.5 TWH.Y(-1)); OTHERWISE, INCREASED OPERATION OF FOSSIL-FUEL PLANTS OFFSETS GAS SAVINGS (BAU, +2 TWH.Y(-1)). NONETHELESS, FEEDBACKS ON OTHER PRODUCTIVE SECTORS ENTAIL ADDITIONAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS, THUS COUNTERPOISING POSITIVE EFFECTS OBTAINED WITHIN THE ENERGY SECTOR EVEN IN THE SEN SCENARIO.

IN THIS RESEARCH, WE APPROACH THE RESOURCE NEXUS THROUGH THE CONCEPT OF NEXUS PATHWAYS. NEXUS PATHWAYS ARE CONFIGURATIONS THAT RESOURCE FLOWS FOLLOW ALONG SUPPLY CHAINS LEADING TO THE COMBINED USE OF TWO OR MORE RESOURCES. THREE GENERAL TYPES OF PATHWAYS ARE IDENTIFIED: DIRECT (ON-SITE USE), DEPENDENT (ONE-WAY SUPPLY CHAINS), AND INTERDEPENDENT (SUPPLY-CHAIN FEEDBACKS). WE QUANTIFY AND COMPARE EACH PATHWAY BY MEANS OF MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURAL PATH ANALYSIS, AND APPLY THIS APPROACH TO A COMPARATIVE CASE STUDY ON THE WATER-ENERGY NEXUS (WEN) IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. INTERDEPENDENCIES OR FEEDBACKS ARE GENERALLY THOUGHT TO BE RELEVANT FOR THE WEN, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN WATER AND ENERGY SECTORS. OUR ECONOMY-WIDE ANALYSIS FOR BOTH COUNTRIES INDICATES, HOWEVER, THAT FEEDBACKS NEITHER PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE WEN NOR SUBSTANTIALLY TAKE PLACE BETWEEN WATER AND ENERGY SECTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT FEEDBACKS CONTRIBUTE TO LESS THAN 1\% OF TOTAL RESOURCE USE, AND THESE TAKE PLACE MOSTLY BETWEEN MANUFACTURING SECTORS.

OUR ANALYSIS FOUND THAT MORE CARBON EMISSIONS HAD RELOCATED FROM EAST TO WEST WITH DOMESTIC INDUSTRY RELOCATION, YET THE OPPOSITE WAS FOUND FOR VALUE ADDED. SPECIFICALLY, CARBON INTENSIVE SECTORS SHOWED CLEAR TENDENCIES OF SHIFTING WEST. CAPITAL FORMATION WAS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF THE POLLUTION HAVEN EFFECTS FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. THUS, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLUTION HAVEN EFFECTS EXIST IN THE RELOCATION PROCESSES OF MOST SECTORS. IN TURN, OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT MITIGATION POLICIES SHOULD DIFFER BY REGION AND BY INDUSTRY. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE A NEGATIVE LIST FOR REGIONS IN THE WEST, A MITIGATION POLICY FOR INDUSTRIES WITH HIGH POLLUTION, AND DIFFERENTIATED SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL DEMANDS.

AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN CHINESE ECONOMY IS THUS IMPORTANT TO MITIGATE RESOURCE SCARCITY AT THE GLOBAL SCALE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE NATURAL RESOURCE FLOWS WITHIN THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM OF CHINA FROM THE RAW MATERIAL EXTRACTION TO THE FINAL PRODUCTION. WE IDENTIFY CRITICAL SECTORS USING A VARIETY OF METHODS AND CONSIDER THE VARIOUS ROLES OF THE SECTORS IN THE CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN THE ECONOMY. WE ALSO IDENTIFY CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN PATHS USING A STRUCTURAL PATH ANALYSIS (SPA). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE INTERMEDIATE-BASED APPROACH COMPLEMENTS THE TRADITIONAL DIRECT AND CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACHES AND HIGHLIGHTS CRITICAL SECTORS FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF DOMESTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IN CHINA SUCH AS CROP CULTIVATION, COTTON AND CHEMICAL FIBER PRODUCTS, AND GLASS PRODUCTS. THE MOST CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN PATHS ORIGINATE FROM THE RESOURCE EXTRACTION SECTORS AND ULTIMATELY END IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR (E.G., STONE, LIME, PLASTER, CERAMIC), GIVEN THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE DOMESTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IS DRIVEN BY THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. TO REDUCE THE CONSUMPTION OF DOMESTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IN CHINA, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON THE CRITICAL SECTORS AND SUPPLY CHAIN PATHS IDENTIFIED USING OUR METHODS FOR TARGETED POLICY INTERVENTIONS.

IN THIS CONTEXT, AN IMPORTANT INCREASE OF SMALL-SCALE POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES IS EXPECTED IN SPAIN BY 2020, ACCORDING TO THE SPANISH ACTION PLAN FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE MASSIVE INTEGRATION OF RDG IN SPAIN FOR 2020 BY USING AN INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH. THE INDUCED PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS IN EVERY SECTOR DUE TO NEW RDG PROJECT INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS THE CO2 REDUCTIONS ATTRIBUTED TO A DECLINE IN CONVENTIONAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION ARE ESTIMATED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT INVESTMENTS IN RDG BASED ON PHOTOVOLTAIC AND SMALL-HYDRO HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT GENERATION. THE RDG INVESTMENTS WILL LEAD TO A DECREASE IN EMISSIONS OF 21.67\% IN 2020 COMPARED WITH 2013. THE RDG TECHNOLOGIES BECOME AN ALTERNATIVE TO REACH A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN SPAIN. IN FUTURE RESEARCH, A MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL AND THE STUDY OF THE LINKS BETWEEN ENERGY CONSUMPTION, STANDARD OF LIVING AND CONSUMPTION PATTERNS WILL AID TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF SMALL-SCALE RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES.
