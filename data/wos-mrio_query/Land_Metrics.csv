THIS IS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY GLOBAL WITH COUNTRIES RELYING ON EACH OTHER THROUGH TRADE. AS SUCH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A MECHANISM IN PLACE TO UNDERSTAND THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN SHIFTS FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER. TO THIS END, THIS PAPER EXPLOITS A PARADOX IN GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, WHICH STEMS FROM A FALSE DECOUPLING BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AS OBSERVED IN MOST DEVELOPED NATIONS, WHICH RESULTS IN IMPROVED TERRITORIAL EMISSIONS OF THESE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AT THE EXPENSE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ECOLOGICAL UNEQUAL EXCHANGE IS ONE SUCH CONTEMPORARY ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC CONCEPT THAT IS USED TO HIGHLIGHT SUCH ASYMMETRIC TRANSFER OF EMBODIED NATURAL RESOURCES AND BIOPHYSICAL INDICATORS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. ATTEMPTS AT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS REDUCTION EFFORTS HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON CARBON EMISSIONS BUT GIVEN THE COMPLEX SUPPLY CHAIN CREATED THROUGH GLOBALISATION AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER OTHER IMPORTANT METRICS SUCH AS LAND AND WATER USE ALONGSIDE CARBON EMISSIONS TO DRIVE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES THAT WILL HOLISTICALLY ADDRESS ECOLOGICALLY UNEQUAL EXCHANGES. FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN AFRICA WHERE THE DEPENDENCE ON LAND USE AND WATER USE FOR AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES ARE CRUCIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL ECONOMIES AND IN COMBATING POVERTY, AN ASSESSMENT OF THESE METRICS HAS BECOME EVEN MORE PARAMOUNT. AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, THE CURRENT WORK DRAWS UPON THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS OF MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) FRAMEWORK TO TRACE COUNTRY SPECIFIC SECTORIAL-LEVEL FLOWS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED METRICS BETWEEN A REPRESENTATIVE DEVELOPED NATION, UK, AND 27 AFRICAN REGIONS IN ORDER TO FULLY EXAMINE THEIR ECOLOGICAL EXCHANGES. KEY FINDINGS IN THE STUDY SUGGEST THAT FOR WATER CONSUMPTION AND LAND USE, THERE IS A NET EXTERNALISATION OF THESE IMPACTS FOR ALL THE 27 AFRICAN REGIONS BY THE UK. IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE EXTENT OF THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE UK AND THE AFRICAN REGION IS EXCEEDINGLY FAR GREATER FOR WATER CONSUMPTION. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT IN FORMULATING A ROBUST MULTI-NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY WHERE SO MANY FACTORS ARE AT PLAY, COUNTRY SPECIFIC AND INDUSTRY TARGETED APPROACH TO ECOLOGICAL UNEQUAL EXCHANGE BETWEEN NATIONS PROVIDES BETTER AND IMPROVED INSIGHT INTO ADDRESSING ENSUING ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.",""

GLOBAL TRADE LEADS TO TELECOUPLING BETWEEN THE LAND USE OF PRODUCTION AND THE CONSUMPTION OF BIOMASS-BASED GOODS AND SERVICES. TELECOUPLING IS CAPTURED BY ACCOUNTS OF THE UPSTREAM LAND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRADED PRODUCTS, ALSO COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS LAND FOOTPRINTS. THESE ACCOUNTS FACE CHALLENGES IN TWO MAIN AREAS: (1) THE ALLOCATION OF LAND TO PRODUCTS TRADED AND CONSUMED AND (2) THE METRICS TO ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENCES IN LAND QUALITY AND LAND-USE INTENSITY. FOR TWO MAIN FAMILIES OF ACCOUNTING APPROACHES (BIOPHYSICAL, FACTOR-BASED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS), THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES AND COMPARES RESULTS FOR LAND FOOTPRINTS. BIOPHYSICAL APPROACHES ARE ABLE TO CAPTURE A LARGE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS AND DIFFERENT LAND USES, BUT SUFFER FROM A TRUNCATION PROBLEM. ECONOMIC APPROACHES SOLVE THE TRUNCATION PROBLEM, BUT ARE HAMPERED BY THE LIMITED DISAGGREGATION OF SECTORS AND PRODUCTS. IN LIGHT OF THE CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES, THE OVERALL SIMILARITY OF RESULTS GENERATED BY BOTH TYPES OF APPROACHES IS REMARKABLE. DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED RESULTS FOR SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS OF BIOMASS-BASED PRODUCTS, HOWEVER, MAKE INTERPRETATION DIFFICULT. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO PROVIDE CLARITY ON SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CONCEPTUAL ISSUES OF ACCOUNTING FOR LAND FOOTPRINTS.",""

THIS PAPER DEVELOPS A PRODUCTION-BASED INVENTORY OF LAND USE (I.E., THE LAND USED TO PRODUCE GOODS) IN THE U.S. WITH THIS INVENTORY AN INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS IS USED TO CREATE A CONSUMPTION-BASED INVENTORY OF LAND USE. THIS ALLOWS FOR EXPLORATION OF LINKS BETWEEN LAND USED IN PRODUCTION TO THE CONSUMPTION OF PARTICULAR GOODS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF CROPLAND EMBODIED IN PROCESSED FOODS OR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AS WOULD BE EXPECTED, AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY INDUSTRIES ARE THE LARGEST USERS OF LAND IN THE PRODUCTION-BASED INVENTORY. SIMILARLY, WE FIND THAT PROCESSED FOODS AND FOREST PRODUCTS ARE THE LARGEST USERS OF LAND IN THE CONSUMPTION-BASED INVENTORY. SOMEWHAT LESS EXPECTEDLY THIS WORK FINDS THAT THE MAJORITY OF MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES, NOT TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LAND USE, REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF LAND TO PRODUCE OUTPUT DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF FOOD AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL AND WOOD-BASED PRODUCTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE QUANTITATIVE LAND USE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS COULD BE INTEGRATED WITH QUALITATIVE METRICS SUCH AS WEIGHTING SCHEMES DESIGNED TO REFLECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OR LIFE CYCLE IMPACT ASSESSMENT METHODS.",""
