A NUMBER OF ECOLOGICAL MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED OVER THE LAST DECADES TO DEVELOP THESE BIODIVERSITY SCENARIOS. NOVEL MODELLING APPROACHES WITH STRONG THEORETICAL FOUNDATION NOW OFFER THE POSSIBILITY TO INTEGRATE KEY ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES THAT SHAPE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. ALTHOUGH BIODIVERSITY IS AFFECTED BY MULTIPLE THREATS, MOST STUDIES ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ON BIODIVERSITY FOCUS ON A SINGLE THREAT ONLY. WE EXAMINED THE STUDIES PUBLISHED DURING THE LAST 25YEARS THAT DEVELOPED SCENARIOS TO PREDICT FUTURE BIODIVERSITY CHANGES BASED ON CLIMATE, LAND-USE AND LAND-COVER CHANGE PROJECTIONS. WE FOUND THAT BIODIVERSITY SCENARIOS MOSTLY FOCUS ON THE FUTURE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND LARGELY NEGLECT CHANGES IN LAND USE AND LAND COVER. THE EMPHASIS ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS HAS INCREASED OVER TIME AND HAS NOW REACHED A MAXIMUM. YET, THE DIRECT DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF HABITATS THROUGH LAND-USE AND LAND-COVER CHANGES ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND IMMEDIATE THREATS TO BIODIVERSITY. WE ARGUE THAT THE CURRENT STATE OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL AND LAND SYSTEM SCIENCES IS LEADING TO BIASED ESTIMATION OF ACTUAL RISKS AND THEREFORE CONSTRAINS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FORWARD-LOOKING POLICY RESPONSES TO BIODIVERSITY DECLINE. WE SUGGEST RESEARCH DIRECTIONS AT THE CROSSROADS BETWEEN ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES TO FACE THE CHALLENGE OF DEVELOPING INTEROPERABLE AND PLAUSIBLE PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND TO ANTICIPATE THE FULL RANGE OF THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY. AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL PLATFORM IS NEEDED TO STIMULATE SUCH COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS AND TO EMPHASIZE THE SOCIETAL AND POLITICAL RELEVANCE OF TAKING UP THIS CHALLENGE.",""

IN THIS PAPER, COMBINING A RANGE OF MODELING METHODOLOGIES IS PROPOSED AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER. THE CHOICE OF MODELS TO BE USED WOULD DEPEND ON THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM AND REGION BEING STUDIED. ONE POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF MODELS IS DISCUSSES IN THIS PAPER FOR THE SPECIFIC CASE OF INDIA. THE INTEGRATED MODELING FRAMEWORK (IMF) PROPOSED COMBINES THREE MODELING APPROACHES - I) INDEX DECOMPOSITION TO ESTIMATE IMPACTS OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, II) CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION TO ESTIMATE LEAST COST FUEL OPTIONS FOR THE POWER SECTOR, III) INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. THE MODEL RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MODE OF INVESTMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF THE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCOMES, AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION IN INDIA. IN SOME SCENARIOS, HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN GREEN ENERGY NEGATIVELY AFFECTS LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AS COMPARED TO OTHER HOUSEHOLDS.

IN THIS PAPER WE TAKE A WIDER VIEW ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC STUDIES WITHIN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. WE ANALYSE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BIOPHYSICAL CONTEXT OF THE DELTAS CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, IN THE DELTAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE CONSTRUCT A SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL-EXTENDED MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASES AND SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRICES THAT ARE USED TO TRACE THE FLOW OF PROVISIONING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAINS, PROVIDING A VIEW OF THE LINKS BETWEEN THE BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO INTEGRATE THIS INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL TO ASSESS HOW THE CHANGES IN THE PROVISION OF NATURAL RESOURCES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE CAN POTENTIALLY AFFECT THE ECONOMIES OF THE DELTAS AND LINKED REGIONS, AND HOW THIS IN TURN AFFECTS ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THESE REGIONS.

TO EVALUATE THE WATER-RELATED IMPACTS OF ENERGY-RELATED DECISIONS, WE BUILT A NATIONAL ENERGY WATER NEXUS SCENARIO ANALYSIS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK BY EXTENDING INPUT OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IOA) TO FUTURE ENERGY MIX SCENARIOS OF CHINA. THE SCENARIOS FOR CHINA OUT TO 2050 INCLUDE FOUR LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS THAT ARE PLANNED IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ROADMAPS AND ONE BASELINE SCENARIO. SECTORAL DIRECT ENERGY, DIRECT WATER, WATER-RELATED ENERGY, AND ENERGY-RELATED WATER CONSUMPTION WERE INVENTORIED. SECTORAL EMBODIED CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ENERGY AND THEIR INTER-SECTOR FLOWS WERE MAPPED USING IOA TO CREATE ENERGY WATER NEXUS NETWORKS. A SECTORAL NEXUS WAS DEFINED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE ENERGY WATER LINKAGE ON ENERGY AND WATER SYSTEMS. SECTORAL CONTROL AND DEPENDENCE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REVEALED BY ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT NEXUS IMPACT ON THE WATER SYSTEM WAS LARGER THAN THAT ON THE ENERGY SYSTEM. THE MAIN EXPORT AND IMPORT PAIRS-CHEMICAL INDUSTRY-AGRICULTURE (AG), MANUFACTURING-AG, AG METAL SMELTING AND PRESSING (ME), AND ME-ELECTRICITY (EL) SHOULD BE CRITICAL PATHWAYS FOR NEXUS MANAGEMENT VIA THE ADJUSTMENT OF SECTORAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS. THE SECTORS WITH A HIGH NEXUS IMPACT-AG, EL, AND ME-SHOULD DECREASE THEIR ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION TO ACHIEVE OUTSIZED SYSTEM-WIDE SAVINGS. SECTORS WITH A LOW NEXUS IMPACT SUCH AS DOMESTIC SERVICES; TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND POST SERVICES; AND WATER PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY-CAN INCREASE THEIR ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION WITH A LESSER IMPACT ON THE WIDER SYSTEM. THE LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO EXHIBITED THE LOWEST NEXUS IMPACT, FOLLOWED BY THE ENHANCED LOW-CARBON SCENARIO, WHOSE ENERGY MIX ALSO EXERTED THE LOWEST PRESSURE ON THE WATER SYSTEM. BY ANALYZING THE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN ENERGY, WATER, AND CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER FIVE SCENARIOS, THIS STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHTS FOR NEXUS MANAGEMENT ON HOW TO BALANCE WATER SHORTAGE ISSUES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY GENERATION IN FUTURE ENERGY AND WATER RESOURCE PLANNING.",""

WE CONSIDER ALL FOSSIL FUEL, BIOFUEL AND BIOMASS BURNING AEROSOL EMISSION SOURCES AS ANTHROPOGENIC. THE EFFECTIVE RADIATIVE FORCING FOR AEROSOL-RADIATION INTERACTIONS IS -0.44 W M(-2) AND AEROSOL-CLOUD INTERACTIONS IS -1.64 W M(-2). AEROSOLS COOL AND DRY THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM BY -0.8 DEGREES C AND -0.08 MM PER DAY RELATIVE TO THE AEROSOL-FREE WORLD. WITHOUT AEROSOL POLLUTION, HUMAN-INDUCED GLOBAL WARMING SINCE THE PREINDUSTRIAL WOULD HAVE ALREADY EXCEEDED THE 1.5 DEGREES C ASPIRATIONAL LIMIT SET IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT BY THE 1996-2005 DECADE. AEROSOL CLIMATE IMPACTS ON THE GLOBAL AVERAGE LAND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE SMALL DUE TO LARGE OPPOSITE SIGN EFFECTS IN THE TROPICAL AND BOREAL BIOMES. AEROSOL SLOW FEEDBACKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCEAN STRONGLY DOMINATE IMPACTS IN THE AMAZON AND NORTH AMERICAN BOREAL. AEROSOL COOLING OF THE AMAZON BY -1.2 DEGREES C DRIVES NPP INCREASES OF 8\% OR +0.76 +/- 0.61 PGC PER YEAR, A 5-10 TIMES LARGER IMPACT THAN ESTIMATES OF DIFFUSE RADIATION FERTILIZATION BY BIOMASS BURNING AEROSOL IN THIS REGION. THE NORTH AMERICAN BOREAL SUFFERS GPP AND NPP DECREASES OF 35\% DUE TO AEROSOL-INDUCED COOLING AND DRYING (-1.6 DEGREES C, -0.14 MM PER DAY).

THIS CORRELATION DOES NOT CHANGE MUCH FROM EPOCH-I TO EPOCH-II. HOWEVER, THE CORRELATION PATTERN OF SURFACE AIR PRESSURE ANOMALIES WITH VARIATIONS OF ANOMALOUS AM OVER LANDS CHANGES REMARKABLY FROM EPOCH-I TO EPOCH-II; THE EPAR PATTERN EMERGES EVIDENTLY IN THE LATER PERIOD, WHEREAS IT IS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN EPOCH-I. THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EPAR PATTERN IN EPOCH-II MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION (PDO). THE PDO MAY MODULATE THE EPAR PATTERN IN TWO WAYS. FIRSTLY, THE INTERDECADAL COMPONENT OF THE PDO AS A BACKGROUND MAY MODULATE THE INTENSITIES OF THE ALEUTIAN LOW, EAST ASIAN TROUGH, AND WESTERLY FLOW, ACTING AS A WAVEGUIDE DURING THE WARM PHASE (EPOCH-II) OF THE PDO. SECONDLY, THE INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS OF SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES IN THE NORTH PACIFIC, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE PDO, MAY AFFECT THE INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS OF AM, WHICH FACILITATES THE EXISTENCE OF THE EPAR PATTERN IN EPOCH-II ONLY.

IN THIS STUDY, IT IS FOUND THAT THE TIBETAN PLATEAU SNOW COVER (TPSC) IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE INTERANNUAL VARIATIONS OF SUMMER HEAT WAVES OVER EURASIA. THE TPSC VARIABILITY EXPLAINS MORE THAN 30 \% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCES OF HEAT WAVE VARIABILITY IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPE AND NORTHEASTERN ASIA (SENA) REGION. A SET OF NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS REVEAL THAT THE REDUCED TPSC MAY INDUCE A DISTINCT TELECONNECTION PATTERN ACROSS THE EURASIAN CONTINENT, WITH TWO ANOMALOUS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERS IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE OVER THE SENA REGION, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF THE CLOUD FORMATION NEAR THE SURFACE. THE LESS CLOUD COVER TENDS TO INCREASE THE NET SHORTWAVE RADIATION AND FAVOR A STRONGER SURFACE SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX IN THE DRY SURFACE CONDITION OVER THE SENA REGION, RESULTING IN A DEEPER, WARMER AND DRIER ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER THAT WOULD FURTHER INHIBIT THE LOCAL CLOUD FORMATION.

WE FOCUS ON THE DECADAL AND INTERDECADAL VARIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AND GIVE A STATISTICAL AND DYNAMICAL DESCRIPTION OF ITS OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC SIGNATURES. IN OUR COUPLED CONTROL INTEGRATION, AN OCEANIC OSCILLATION OF A PERIOD OF AROUND 20 YEARS IS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABILITY OF THE METIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION AND IS MANIFESTED BY SURFACE ANOMALIES OF TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY. ON SUCH TIMESCALES THE OCEANIC OSCILLATION IS ABLE TO IMPRINT ITSELF ON THE ATMOSPHERE, WHICH THEN COVATIES WITH THE OCEAN AT THE OSCILLATION PERIOD. THE ESSENTIALLY SLAVED ATMOSPHERIC PATTERN HELPS MAINTAIN THE OCEANIC OSCILLATION BY PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ANOMALOUS HEAT FLUXES, SO CATALYZING THE OSCILLATION. THAT IS TO SAY, BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE COVARIES WITH THE OCEAN THE DAMPING FELT BY THE OCEAN IS LESS THAN WHAT WOULD BE FELT WITH A FIXED ATMOSPHERE, SO BROADENING THE PARAMETER REGIME OVER WHICH SUCH VARIABILITY OCCURS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRESENCE OF AN ATMOSPHERE, THE PERIOD AND AMPLITUDE OF THE OSCILLATION ARE FOUND TO BE INFLUENCED BOTH BY THE OCEANIC VERTICAL DIFFUSIVITY KAPPA(V), BY GEOMETRICAL FACTORS, AND BY THE PRESENCE OF STOCHASTIC HEAT FLUXES. IN GENERAL, OSCILLATIONS OCCUR MOST READILY FOR LARGE VALUES OF KAPPA(V), WHEN THE MEAN STATE OF THE OCEAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY A STRONG MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION. IF KAPPA(V) IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG, THE OCEAN WILL OSCILLATE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A DYNAMICAL ATMOSPHERE. HOWEVER, FOR MORE REALISTIC VALUES OF ICY, THE PRESENCE OF AN INTERACTING ATMOSPHERE IS REQUIRED FOR SIGNIFICANT OSCILLATIONS. IF THE OCEAN IS FORCED BY IMPOSED STOCHASTIC HEAT FLUXES, INSTEAD OF A FULLY INTERACTING ATMOSPHERE, THEN DECADAL-SCALE OSCILLATIONS CAN BE PRODUCED SUGGESTIVE OF A DAMPED OSCILLATOR. HOWEVER, THE PARAMETER RANGE OVER WHICH OSCILLATIONS OCCUR IS SMALLER THAN WHEN THE OCEAN IS COUPLED TO FULL ATMOSPHERE. MORE GENERICALLY, THE ABILITY OF COMPREHENSIVE COUPLED OCEAN ATMOSPHERE MODELS TO PRODUCE MULTI-DECADAL VARIABILITY, REALISTIC OR OTHERWISE, WILL DEPEND ON THE OCEANIC MEAN STATE, AND SO ON THE DIAPYCNAL DIFFUSIVITY OF THE MODELLED OCEAN, AS WELL AS ON THE ABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO REDUCE THE DAMPING FELT BY THE OCEAN AND SO ON THE ATMOSPHERE'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO PERSISTENT SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES.",""

THE FIRST MODE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TURNABOUT OF WARMING TO COOLING IN THE EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO), WHEREAS THE SECOND MODE LEADS THE WARMING/COOLING BY ABOUT 1 YEAR, SIGNALING PRECURSORY CONDITIONS FOR ENSO. THE FIRST MODE HAS A STRONG BIENNIAL TENDENCY AND REFLECTS THE TROPICAL BIENNIAL OSCILLATION (MEEHL IN J CLIM 6:31-41, 1993).

DESPITE INCREASED CYCLONE ACTIVITY, TOTAL WINTERTIME PRECIPITATION IS BELOW NORMAL DURING A POSITIVE PNA PATTERN BECAUSE OF ENHANCED STABILITY AND SUBSIDENCE OVER LAND, ALONG WITH LOWER-ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE CONTENT. LOWER SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURES DURING A POSITIVE PNA PATTERN RESULT IN ENHANCED SIMULATED CLOUD COVER OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND ATLANTIC OCEAN DUE TO INCREASED THERMAL CONTRAST AND FLUXES OF SENSIBLE AND LATENT HEAT, AND A REDUCTION IN CLOUDS OVER LAND. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE PNA AND NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO) PATTERNS IMPACT THE NORTHEAST WINTER CLIMATE. OBSERVED FRONTAL PASSAGES THROUGH NEW YORK ARE MOST ABUNDANT DURING A NEGATIVE PNA AND POSITIVE NAO PATTERN, WITH A ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL JET POSITIONED OVER NEW YORK.

A HYPOTHESIS IS TESTED THAT THE VARIABILITY OF THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC SOUTH ASIAN HIGH (SAH), WHICH IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL HEATING OF THE LARGE-SCALE ASIAN MONSOON, IS LINKED TO CHANGES IN THE SUBTROPICAL WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH (SWPH), THE MID-PACIFIC TROUGH, AND THE MEXICAN HIGH. THE CHANGES IN THESE CIRCULATION SYSTEMS CAUSE VARIABILITY IN SURFACE TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION IN THE APA REGION. A STRONGER SAH IS ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONGER AND MORE EXTENSIVE SWPH. THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE SWPH WEAKENS THE MID-PACIFIC TROUGH. AS A RESULT, THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE MEXICAN HIGH BECOMES STRONGER. THESE CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC TELECONNECTIONS, PRECIPITATION, AND SURFACE TEMPERATURE THROUGHOUT THE APA REGION. WHEN THE SAH IS STRONGER, PRECIPITATION INCREASES IN SOUTHERN ASIA, DECREASES OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN, AND INCREASES OVER THE CENTRAL AMERICA.

IN THIS STUDY THE ROLE OF AUTUMN LAND SURFACE SNOW CONDITIONS IS INVESTIGATED. SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS OF HISTORICAL AUTUMN-WINTER SNOW COVER ARE APPLIED OVER SIBERIA AS MODEL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR TWO SNOW-FORCED EXPERIMENTS, ONE USING THE HIGHEST OBSERVED AUTUMN SNOW COVER EXTENT OVER SIBERIA (1976) AND ANOTHER USING THE LOWEST EXTENT (1988). THE ENSEMBLE-MEAN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SNOW-FORCED EXPERIMENTS IS COMPUTED TO EVALUATE THE CLIMATIC RESPONSE TO SIBERIAN SNOW CONDITIONS. EXPERIMENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SIBERIAN SNOW CONDITIONS EXERT A MODULATING INFLUENCE ON THE PREDOMINANT WINTERTIME NORTHERN HEMISPHERE (AO) MODE. FURTHERMORE, AN ATMOSPHERIC TELECONNECTION PATHWAY IS IDENTIFIED, INVOLVING WELL-KNOWN WAVE MEAN FLOW INTERACTION PROCESSES THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE AND STRATOSPHERE. ANOMALOUSLY HIGH SIBERIAN SNOW INCREASES LOCAL UPWARD STATIONARY WAVE FLUX ACTIVITY, WEAKENS THE STRATOSPHERIC POLAR VORTEX, AND CAUSES UPPER-TROPOSPHERE STATIONARY WAVES TO REFRACT POLEWARD.

THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS WARMING ON REMOTE TROPICAL CLIMATES IS EXAMINED THROUGH INVESTIGATING THE ADJUSTMENT OF A SINGLE-COLUMN MODEL TO IMPOSED TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS, ASSUMING THAT ENSO CONTROLS INTERANNUAL TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS AT ALL TROPICAL LOCATIONS. THE COLUMN MODEL PREDICTS THE IMPACT OF THESE VARIATIONS IN THREE TYPICAL TROPICAL CLIMATE STATES (PRECIPITATION. EVAPORATION; PRECIPITATION, EVAPORATION; NO CONVECTION) OVER A SLAB MIXED LAYER OCEAN. MODEL PRECIPITATION AND SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) RESPOND SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE IMPOSED TROPOSPHERIC FORCING IN THE FIRST TWO CLIMATE STATES. THEIR AMPLITUDE AND PHASE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE IMPOSED MIXED LAYER DEPTH, WITH THE NATURE OF THE RESPONSE DEPENDING ON HOW FAST THE OCEAN ADJUSTS TO IMPOSED TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE FORCING. FOR LARGER MIXED LAYER DEPTH, THE SST LAGS THE TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE BY A LONGER TIME, ALLOWING GREATER DISEQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN.

IN MOST REGARDS, THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION ARE REPRODUCED REASONABLY WELL BY THE GFS WHEN COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSES OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AS FOR THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES, THE MAJOR FEATURES OF OBSERVED PRECIPITATION, SUCH AS THE INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE (ITCZ), THE ASIAN MONSOON REGIMES, AND THE EXTRATROPICAL STORM TRACKS, ARE WELL CAPTURED IN THE GFS SIMULATION. SIMILARLY, OTHER CLIMATE FEATURES OF OBSERVED PRECIPITATION, NAMELY THE REGIONS OF LOW PRECIPITATION RATES OVER THE SUBTROPICAL SUBSIDENCE ZONES AND POLAR AREAS, ARE ALSO WELL DEFINED BY THE GFS. THE SIMULATED PRECIPITATION PATTERN, HOWEVER, EXHIBITS SOME OBVIOUS DISCREPANCIES FROM THE OBSERVED IN THE TROPICS. EXCESSIVE PRECIPITATION IS SIMULATED BY THE GFS OVER SOME TROPICAL REGIONS WHERE THERE ARE COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHIC VARIATIONS AMONG OCEANS AND LANDS. OTHERWISE, THE GFS PRECIPITATION IN THE REMAINING TROPICAL REGIONS IS GENERALLY UNDERESTIMATED. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNDERESTIMATE OF MODEL PRECIPITATION OVER THE TROPICAL EASTERN PACIFIC RESULTS IN A LOCAL ITCZ THAT IS LESS ORGANIZED IN SPATIAL STRUCTURE THAN THE OBSERVED. THIS MODEL PRECIPITATION DEFICIENCY IS LINKED TO UNDERESTIMATES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT AND WATER VAPOR CONVERGENCE OVER THE TROPICAL EASTERN PACIFIC IN THE GFS SIMULATION. REGARDING THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ZONAL MEAN STATE, THE ZONAL MEAN CLIMATOLOGIES OF TEMPERATURE AND ZONAL WIND ARE ADEQUATELY SIMULATED BY THE GFS WHEN COMPARED TO ANALYSES. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SIMULATED AND ANALYZED ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURES IS A SYSTEMATIC COLD BIAS IN THE MODEL TROPOSPHERE. THIS COLD BIAS IS GENERALLY WITHIN 4 DEGREES K OF THE ANALYSES FOR MOST OF THE TROPOSPHERIC DOMAIN BOUNDED BY 40 DEGREES S AND 40 DEGREES N. THE MODEL COLD BIAS BECOMES SIGNIFICANT AT THE POLAR TROPOPAUSE, WHERE THE SIMULATED ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURE CAN BE FROM 8 DEGREES K TO 18 DEGREES K COLDER THAN THE ANALYZED. ALSO NOTEWORTHY IS THE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURE BIAS AND ZONAL MEAN ZONAL WIND BIAS.

THE FINDINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) WHILE CHINA'S DIRECT GHG EMISSIONS INCREASED FROM 3,040.60 MILLION TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT (MTCO(2)EQ) TO 10,641.10 MTCO(2)EQ DURING 1991-2014, DECLINING TRENDS WERE OBSERVED IN THE TOTAL AND 16 SECTORS' DIRECT GHG EMISSIONS IN THE SUBSEQUENT TWO YEARS; (2) ALTHOUGH THE RATIOS OF DIRECT GHG EMISSIONS TO TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS IN MOST SECTORS DECREASED, TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS IN EIGHT SECTORS ROSE FIRST AND THEN FELL, AND IN 15 SECTORS CONTINUED TO RISE; (3) CHINA'S GREEN GDP GREW FROM 2,003.88 BILLION CHINESE YUAN TO 26,245.25 BILLION CHINESE YUAN DURING 1991-2016, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA'S GDP AND GREEN GDP DECREASED FROM 2.73\% TO 1.02\%; AND (4) DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OUTPUT VALUE AND GREEN OUTPUT VALUE DECREASED IN OVER 20 SECTORS. FINALLY, SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE GIVEN FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOME KEY SECTORS OF THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURAL SECTOR, AND TRANSPORT, STORAGE, AND POST SECTOR.

FOR CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS WE FIND THAT A CARBON ADDED TAX IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS WHEREAS AN INFORMATION OBLIGATION ON VACANT DWELLINGS COMBINED WITH A PENALTY PAYMENT WHEN VACANT BUILDINGS ARE NOT MADE AVAILABLE IS INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF REALLOCATED INVESTMENT CAPITAL. MANDATORY ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND MOBILITY ARE FOUND EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CONSUMPTION- AND PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS WHILE A DECARBONIZATION OF FREIGHT TRANSPORT LOGISTICS STRONGER REDUCES PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS. OVERALL, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICIES, TO MITIGATE CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS, IS THEREFORE DETERMINED BY THE BACKWARD AND FORWARD LINKAGES OF THE SECTOR ADDRESSED BY THE POLICY AS WELL AS THE SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS WITHIN FINAL DEMAND.",""

RESEARCHERS FOCUSING ON THE GAP BETWEEN CONSUMPTION-BASED AND PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY OUTSOURCING EMISSIONS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, ASYMMETRIES IN EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN TRADE MAY EMERGE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CARBON INTENSITY OF ENERGY AND PRODUCTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND NEED NOT BE EVIDENCE OF OUTSOURCING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES IF PREVIOUS RESULTS CONCERNING EMISSION IN AND OUTSOURCING OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HOLD WHEN EMISSION FLOWS ARE ADJUSTED FOR TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES. TWO STRIKING RESULTS ARE DEMONSTRATED: FIRST, THE MAGNITUDE OF OUTSOURCING IS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED, AND, SECOND, THERE IS NO CLEAR DIVIDE BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. LARGE DEVELOPED ANGLOPHONE COUNTRIES (US, UK, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA) WERE INCREASINGLY OUTSOURCING EMISSIONS BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 BY SHIFTING TOWARD MORE CARBON-INTENSIVE GOODS IN THEIR IMPARTS AND LESS CARBON INTENSIVE GOODS IN EXPORTS, WHEREAS OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (I.E. THE NORDICS, ADVANCED ASIA AND EVEN THE AGGREGATE EU-27) MAINTAINED A POSITIVE EMISSION TRADE BALANCE. AMONG MAJOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, CHINA IS A MAJOR INSOURCER OF EMISSIONS, WHILE OTHER EMERGING ECONOMIES SHOW NO CONSISTENT PATTERN (E.G. INDIA, TURKEY AND BRAZIL) OR MARGINAL OUTSOURCING (E.G. INDONESIA AND MEXICO). THESE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE ON GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS.",""

ACCORDINGLY, A DUAL LAYER MATHEMATICAL MODEL IS DEVELOPED IN WHICH TECHNO-ECONOMIC AND LIFE CYCLE ANALYSES ARE INTEGRATED IN THE FIRST LAYER USING A NOVEL SELF-SUSTAINABILITY FLOWCHART AND THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE WATER, ENERGY, AND CARBON SECTORS ARE INVESTIGATED IN THE SECOND LAYER USING AN INPUT/OUTPUT ANALYSIS. A WATER AND ENERGY INTENSIVE SYSTEM CONSISTING OF NON-RENEWABLE (NRES) AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SUBSYSTEMS (HRES), A REVERSE OSMOSIS MODULE AND A FUEL CYCLE, IS STUDIED USING THE APPROACH AND THE RESULTS ARE VALIDATED AND CALIBRATED ACCORDING TO THE RELEVANT LITERATURE. FOUR SCENARIOS INCLUDING AN NRES FUELED BY PULVERIZED COAL (I) AND NATURAL GAS (II), A HYBRID NRES AND HRES APPLICATION (III), AND A POWER AND FRESHWATER COGENERATION SYSTEM (IV) ARE COMPARED FROM BOTH ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIEWPOINTS. FINALLY, THE APPLICABILITY OF THE CONTROLLED NRES IS INVESTIGATED USING ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND COMBINED ENVIRONMENTAL-ECONOMIC COST OF PRODUCTS (CEECP) AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MODEL RESPONSES WITH RESPECT TO THE MANIPULATING VARIABLE IS STUDIED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT CEECP WAS OBTAINED TO BE 164.7, 134.1, 515.2, AND 134.1 \$/MWH IN THE SCENARIOS I, II, III, AND IV, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, THE OPERATIONAL WATER WITHDRAWAL COULD BE DECREASED BY 1.7-3.2\% IN FAVOR OF ADDITIONAL 0.03-0.05\% OF CO2-EQ EMISSIONS BY EMPLOYING A CONTROLLED POWER PLANT. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD.
