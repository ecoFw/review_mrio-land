IN THIS PAPER, COMBINING A RANGE OF MODELING METHODOLOGIES IS PROPOSED AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER. THE CHOICE OF MODELS TO BE USED WOULD DEPEND ON THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTEM AND REGION BEING STUDIED. ONE POSSIBLE COMBINATION OF MODELS IS DISCUSSES IN THIS PAPER FOR THE SPECIFIC CASE OF INDIA. THE INTEGRATED MODELING FRAMEWORK (IMF) PROPOSED COMBINES THREE MODELING APPROACHES - I) INDEX DECOMPOSITION TO ESTIMATE IMPACTS OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY, II) CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION TO ESTIMATE LEAST COST FUEL OPTIONS FOR THE POWER SECTOR, III) INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE ECONOMIC IMPACTS. THE MODEL RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MODE OF INVESTMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF THE IMPACT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH, INCOMES, AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION IN INDIA. IN SOME SCENARIOS, HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN GREEN ENERGY NEGATIVELY AFFECTS LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AS COMPARED TO OTHER HOUSEHOLDS. THE PAPER ALSO DEMONSTRATES HOW THE IMF CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONS FOR AND THEREFORE ALLEVIATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. (C) 2018 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

INCREASES IN SUCH EVENTS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE DELTAS, WHICH TRANSLATES INTO CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ECOSYSTEMS AND, ULTIMATELY, INTO IMPACTS ON LIVELIHOODS AND HUMAN WELL-BEING. ACCORDINGLY, CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY THE BIOPHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF DELTAIC ENVIRONMENTS BUT ALSO THEIR ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHERMORE, THESE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS WILL SPILL OVER TO OTHER REGIONS THROUGH GOODS AND SERVICES SUPPLY CHAINS AND VIA MIGRATION. IN THIS PAPER WE TAKE A WIDER VIEW ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC STUDIES WITHIN THIS SPECIAL ISSUE. WE ANALYSE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BIOPHYSICAL CONTEXT OF THE DELTAS CONTRIBUTES TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, IN THE DELTAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE CONSTRUCT A SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL-EXTENDED MULTIREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASES AND SOCIAL ACCOUNTING MATRICES THAT ARE USED TO TRACE THE FLOW OF PROVISIONING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAINS, PROVIDING A VIEW OF THE LINKS BETWEEN THE BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO INTEGRATE THIS INFORMATION INTO A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODEL TO ASSESS HOW THE CHANGES IN THE PROVISION OF NATURAL RESOURCES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE CAN POTENTIALLY AFFECT THE ECONOMIES OF THE DELTAS AND LINKED REGIONS, AND HOW THIS IN TURN AFFECTS ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN THESE REGIONS.

TO EVALUATE THE WATER-RELATED IMPACTS OF ENERGY-RELATED DECISIONS, WE BUILT A NATIONAL ENERGY WATER NEXUS SCENARIO ANALYSIS ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK BY EXTENDING INPUT OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IOA) TO FUTURE ENERGY MIX SCENARIOS OF CHINA. THE SCENARIOS FOR CHINA OUT TO 2050 INCLUDE FOUR LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS THAT ARE PLANNED IN CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ROADMAPS AND ONE BASELINE SCENARIO. SECTORAL DIRECT ENERGY, DIRECT WATER, WATER-RELATED ENERGY, AND ENERGY-RELATED WATER CONSUMPTION WERE INVENTORIED. SECTORAL EMBODIED CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ENERGY AND THEIR INTER-SECTOR FLOWS WERE MAPPED USING IOA TO CREATE ENERGY WATER NEXUS NETWORKS. A SECTORAL NEXUS WAS DEFINED TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE ENERGY WATER LINKAGE ON ENERGY AND WATER SYSTEMS. SECTORAL CONTROL AND DEPENDENCE RELATIONSHIPS WERE REVEALED BY ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT NEXUS IMPACT ON THE WATER SYSTEM WAS LARGER THAN THAT ON THE ENERGY SYSTEM. THE MAIN EXPORT AND IMPORT PAIRS-CHEMICAL INDUSTRY-AGRICULTURE (AG), MANUFACTURING-AG, AG METAL SMELTING AND PRESSING (ME), AND ME-ELECTRICITY (EL) SHOULD BE CRITICAL PATHWAYS FOR NEXUS MANAGEMENT VIA THE ADJUSTMENT OF SECTORAL ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS. THE SECTORS WITH A HIGH NEXUS IMPACT-AG, EL, AND ME-SHOULD DECREASE THEIR ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION TO ACHIEVE OUTSIZED SYSTEM-WIDE SAVINGS. SECTORS WITH A LOW NEXUS IMPACT SUCH AS DOMESTIC SERVICES; TRANSPORT, STORAGE AND POST SERVICES; AND WATER PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY-CAN INCREASE THEIR ENERGY AND WATER CONSUMPTION WITH A LESSER IMPACT ON THE WIDER SYSTEM. THE LOW-CARBON-DEVELOPMENT SCENARIO EXHIBITED THE LOWEST NEXUS IMPACT, FOLLOWED BY THE ENHANCED LOW-CARBON SCENARIO, WHOSE ENERGY MIX ALSO EXERTED THE LOWEST PRESSURE ON THE WATER SYSTEM. BY ANALYZING THE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN ENERGY, WATER, AND CARBON EMISSIONS UNDER FIVE SCENARIOS, THIS STUDY PROVIDES INSIGHTS FOR NEXUS MANAGEMENT ON HOW TO BALANCE WATER SHORTAGE ISSUES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY GENERATION IN FUTURE ENERGY AND WATER RESOURCE PLANNING.",""

AN INPUT-OUTPUT BASED LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODEL IS DEVELOPED IN THIS WORK TO EVALUATE THE MAXIMUM GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED, GIVEN VARIOUS CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. SIX SCENARIOS ARE CONSIDERED TO IDENTIFY THE HIGHEST GHG EMISSION REDUCTION THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY THE YEAR 2030. THESE SCENARIOS INCLUDE BAU, THE CONSIDERATION OF TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DIFFERENTIATED SECTOR GROWTH, THE ADOPTION OF A LOW-CARBON ELECTRICITY MIX, ENERGY EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT FOR FINAL CONSUMPTION, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT IN THE AGRICULTURE, TRANSPORT AND WASTE SECTORS. EACH SCENARIO QUANTIFIES THE SECTOR FINAL DEMAND, SECTOR GROSS OUTPUT, SECTOR GHG EMISSION LOAD AND THE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH.

WE SHOW THAT VIRTUAL WATER TRADE AND IMPROVED WATER EFFICIENCY HAS POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE THE WORST EFFECTS OF WATER SCARCITY FOR WEALTHY COUNTRIES BUT MAY HAVE LIMITED EFFECT ON POORER COUNTRIES. THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDES THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT DRIVER OF FUTURE WATER SCARCITY IS ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHICH OVERWHELMS ANY REALISTIC SAVINGS THAT CAN BE MADE FROM INCREASED TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO WATER EFFICIENCY.

ACCORDING TO OUR ANALYSIS, SOUTH KOREA, A NON-ANNEX I COUNTRY, HAS MORE ENERGY-INTENSIVE PRODUCTION STRUCTURES THAN JAPAN, AN ANNEX I COUNTRY. SOUTH KOREA'S TRADE PATTERN WITH JAPAN REFLECTS THESE PRODUCTION FEATURES, RESULTING IN THE KOREA'S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE IN EMISSION INTENSIVE PRODUCTS, THOUGH THE DEGREE HAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED IN 1995 COMPARED TO 1990.

ALTHOUGH THIS ANALYTICAL STEP IS COMPLEX AND OFTEN HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT CAN ALLOW FOR PRIORITIZATION AMONG DISPARATE MIDPOINTS AND SUBSEQUENT ANALYTICAL REFINEMENTS FOCUSED ON THE ENDPOINTS THAT DOMINATE POLICY DECISIONS.

WE USE THE CASE OF INCREASED RESIDENTIAL INSULATION AS A MEASURE TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION, WHICH IMPLIES ECONOMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH TRADEOFFS ACROSS ALL THREE CATEGORIES. WE APPLY PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED MODELS THAT COMBINED INPUT-OUTPUT LCA AND RISK ASSESSMENT TO ADDRESS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS FROM PARTICULATE MATTER, AND EXTEND THE FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS GREENHOUSE GASES AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN INCOME. FOR A HYPOTHETICAL LOAN PROGRAM APPLIED TO BOTH NEW AND EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, WE FIND A PAYBACK PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR FOR THE PARTICULATE MATTER AND GREENHOUSE GAS-RELATED MIDPOINTS AND ENDPOINTS, WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE LOAN IMPLYING THAT NO ECONOMIC PAYBACK IS REQUIRED. OUR CENTRAL ESTIMATES FOR AVOIDED DISABILITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALYS) FOR A 50-YEAR PERIOD ARE APPROXIMATELY 200,000 FOR PARTICULATE MATTER, 900,000 FOR GREENHOUSE GASES, AND 300,000 FOR INCOME CHANGES, ALTHOUGH VALUES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON DISCOUNT RATES AND OTHER MODEL ASSUMPTIONS.

RURAL HOUSEHOLDS ARE IMPACTED MORE HEAVILY THAN URBAN HOUSEHOLDS) IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE PROVINCES. WITHIN EACH SELECTED PROVINCE, CARBON PRICING HAS MOSTLY REGRESSIVE EFFECTS, I.E. POORER URBAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE AFFECTED THAN RICHER URBAN HOUSEHOLDS IN ALL PROVINCES AND POORER RURAL HOUSEHOLDS MORE THAN RICHER RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN ONE THIRD OF THE PROVINCES. WHEN LOOKING MORE SPECIFICALLY AT DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION, WE FIND THAT THE CARBON PRICING ON DOMESTIC FUELS GENERALLY SHOWS REGRESSIVITY, WHILE PRICING CARBON ON TRANSPORT FUELS SHOWS PROGRESSIVITY. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF CARBON PRICING ON RESIDENTIAL DIRECT EXPENDITURES (MAINLY ON ELECTRICITY AND COAL) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REGIONAL REGRESSIVITY ACROSS PROVINCES.

THEY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW RAPIDLY BY POPULATION AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP), WHICH COULD ALSO IMPLY ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. WE USE THE ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASE EXIOBASE IN A CONSUMPTION-BASED APPROACH TO ASSESS CARBON, LAND, AND WATER FOOTPRINTS OF FOUR INCOME GROUPS WITHIN EACH OF THESE EMERGING ECONOMIES IN 2050 COMPARED TO OUR BASE YEAR 2010. WE ESTIMATE THAT CONSUMPTION CHANGES MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCREASE BY A FACTOR OF 1.6 (FOR RUSSIA'S WATER FOOTPRINT) TO A FACTOR OF 7.0 (FOR NIGERIA'S CARBON FOOTPRINT). THIS RISE IS MOSTLY DRIVEN BY GDP GROWTH, BUT OFTEN ALSO BY POPULATION GROWTH. CHANGES IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS DUE TO INCOME GROWTH, HOWEVER, ATTENUATE THE EFFECT. THE ATTENUATION APPEARED TO BE MUCH STRONGER FOR WATER (FOR INDIA AND INDONESIA OVER 50\%) THAN FOR LAND OR CARBON FOOTPRINTS. IT IS HENCE IMPORTANT THAT FORWARD-LOOKING MODELLING EXERCISES ACCOUNT FOR DIFFERENT INCOME CATEGORIES AND RELATED EXPENDITURE PATTERNS. THE RESULTS FURTHER INDICATE HOWMUCH OUR TECHNOLOGIES MUST IMPROVE TO COMPENSATE FOR IMPACT INCREASES INDUCED BY RISING CONSUMPTION. TO COPE WITH THAT, NOT ONLY ESTABLISHED ECONOMIES, BUT ALSO SOME BRIC AND MINT COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY RUSSIA AND CHINA, MUST INCREASE THEIR EFFORTS TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY.

THE PRESENT RESEARCH QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THESE STRATEGIES ON PRIMARY MATERIAL FOOTPRINT (MF) AND CARBON FOOTPRINT (CF) OF HOUSEHOLDS IN AREAS AN URBAN AREA, USING THE CASE OF BRUSSELS CAPITAL REGION (BCR), BELGIUM. BECAUSE THE CE-STRATEGIES ARE LINKED TO CONSUMPTION DOMAINS, THIS ASSESSMENT FIRST CALCULATES BOTH FOOTPRINTS OF CONSUMPTION DOMAINS USING A CITY-LEVEL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FOOTPRINTS. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF BCR IN 2010 WAS 22 MT CO2-EQ. OR 20.3 T/CAP. THE MATERIAL FOOTPRINT OF BCR IN 2010 WAS 31 MT OR 29.5 T/CAP. IMPORTANT INSIGHTS ARE THAT BCR RELIES ON ITS HINTERLAND FOR 98\% OF ITS PRIMARY MATERIALS AND 83\% OF THE REGION'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (GHGS) ARE EMITTED OUTSIDE OF ITS TERRITORY. THE HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION DOMAINS OF FOOD, HOUSING AND TRANSPORT WERE IDENTIFIED AS HOTSPOTS IN BOTH FOOTPRINTS. WITHIN THESE DOMAINS, WE CALCULATED AND DISCUSSED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON BOTH FOOTPRINTS OF CE-STRATEGIES ON CONSUMPTION OR PRODUCTION OF FOOD, MOBILITY AND HOUSING. RESULTS FROM THIS CASE SHOW THAT WITH THESE STRATEGIES BRUSSELS COULD MITIGATE 25\% OF ITS CF AND 26\% OF ITS MF, 18\% OF ITS CF AND 26\% OF ITS MF, AND 7\% OF ITS CF AND 10\% OF ITS MF, RESPECTIVELY. THE METHODOLOGY AND INSIGHTS COULD THEREFORE SUPPORT AUTHORITIES AND POLICY-MAKERS TO EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP COHERENT AND CONSISTENT ACTION PLANS ON CONSUMPTION DOMAINS TO IMPROVE RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE THE GHGS, SIMULTANEOUSLY.

ROBUST METHODS ARE NEEDED FOR BOTH POLICY MAKING AND RESEARCH-FOR EXAMPLE, THE ASSIGNMENT OF BORDER CARBON ADJUSTMENTS (BCAS) AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION RESPONSIBILITIES RELY ON THE CONSISTENCY AND ACCURACY OF SUCH ESTIMATES. THIS ANALYSIS INVESTIGATES THE POTENTIAL MAGNITUDE AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE ERROR PRESENT IN ESTIMATES OF ENERGY AND EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN TRADE AND CONSUMPTION. TO QUANTIFY THE ERROR OF EMBODIED EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING, WE COMPARE THE RESULTS FROM THE DISAGGREGATED GLOBAL TRADE ANALYSIS PROJECT (GTAP 8) DATA SET, WHICH CONTAINS 57 SECTORS TO RESULTS FROM DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AGGREGATION OF THIS DATA SET (3, 7, 16, AND 26 SECTORS), USING 5,000 RANDOMLY GENERATED SECTORAL AGGREGATION SCHEMES AS WELL AS AGGREGATIONS GENERATED USING SEVERAL COMMONLY APPLIED DECISIONS RULES. WE FIND THAT SOME COMMONLY APPLIED DECISION RULES FOR SECTORAL AGGREGATION CAN PRODUCE A LARGE ERROR. WE FURTHER SHOW THAT AN AGGREGATION SCHEME THAT CLUSTERS SECTORS ACCORDING TO THEIR ENERGY, EMISSIONS, AND TRADE INTENSITIES (NET EXPORTS OVER OUTPUT) CAN MINIMIZE ERROR IN EMBODIED ENERGY AND EMISSIONS ACCOUNTING AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AGGREGATION. THIS SECTORAL AGGREGATION SCHEME CAN BE READILY USED IN ANY INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AND PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODELING EXERCISES IN WHICH SECTOR AGGREGATION IS NECESSARY, ALTHOUGH OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE MOST DISAGGREGATED DATA AVAILABLE SHOULD BE USED.",""

EMISSIONS OF FINAL DEMAND THAT ARE EMBODIED ACROSS THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL FRACTIONS. WE ANALYSE A SET OF DIFFERENT POLICIES IN THREE AREAS WITH PARTICULARLY HIGH CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS IN AUSTRIA: BUILDING CONSTRUCTION, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND TRANSPORT. TO CAPTURE THE SUBSTITUTION POSSIBILITIES TRIGGERED BY THESE POLICIES AND THE INDUCED EMISSION REDUCTIONS ALONG THE FULL GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN, OUR ANALYSIS COMBINES A COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM WITH A MULTI REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL. FOR CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS WE FIND THAT A CARBON ADDED TAX IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS WHEREAS AN INFORMATION OBLIGATION ON VACANT DWELLINGS COMBINED WITH A PENALTY PAYMENT WHEN VACANT BUILDINGS ARE NOT MADE AVAILABLE IS INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF REALLOCATED INVESTMENT CAPITAL. MANDATORY ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND MOBILITY ARE FOUND EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CONSUMPTION- AND PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS WHILE A DECARBONIZATION OF FREIGHT TRANSPORT LOGISTICS STRONGER REDUCES PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS. OVERALL, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICIES, TO MITIGATE CONSUMPTION-BASED EMISSIONS, IS THEREFORE DETERMINED BY THE BACKWARD AND FORWARD LINKAGES OF THE SECTOR ADDRESSED BY THE POLICY AS WELL AS THE SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS WITHIN FINAL DEMAND.",""

RESEARCHERS FOCUSING ON THE GAP BETWEEN CONSUMPTION-BASED AND PRODUCTION-BASED EMISSIONS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ARE SYSTEMATICALLY OUTSOURCING EMISSIONS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, ASYMMETRIES IN EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN TRADE MAY EMERGE DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CARBON INTENSITY OF ENERGY AND PRODUCTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND NEED NOT BE EVIDENCE OF OUTSOURCING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES IF PREVIOUS RESULTS CONCERNING EMISSION IN AND OUTSOURCING OF DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HOLD WHEN EMISSION FLOWS ARE ADJUSTED FOR TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES. TWO STRIKING RESULTS ARE DEMONSTRATED: FIRST, THE MAGNITUDE OF OUTSOURCING IS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED, AND, SECOND, THERE IS NO CLEAR DIVIDE BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. LARGE DEVELOPED ANGLOPHONE COUNTRIES (US, UK, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA) WERE INCREASINGLY OUTSOURCING EMISSIONS BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 BY SHIFTING TOWARD MORE CARBON-INTENSIVE GOODS IN THEIR IMPARTS AND LESS CARBON INTENSIVE GOODS IN EXPORTS, WHEREAS OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (I.E. THE NORDICS, ADVANCED ASIA AND EVEN THE AGGREGATE EU-27) MAINTAINED A POSITIVE EMISSION TRADE BALANCE. AMONG MAJOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, CHINA IS A MAJOR INSOURCER OF EMISSIONS, WHILE OTHER EMERGING ECONOMIES SHOW NO CONSISTENT PATTERN (E.G. INDIA, TURKEY AND BRAZIL) OR MARGINAL OUTSOURCING (E.G. INDONESIA AND MEXICO). THESE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE ON GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS.",""
