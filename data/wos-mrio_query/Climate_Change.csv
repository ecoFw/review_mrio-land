THE PRESENT STUDY INCLUDES DATA FROM 96 SECTORS' CROSS-STRAIT INTER-COUNTRY INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE AND THE STATISTICS OF AGRICULTURE DURING 2005-2011 IN TAIWAN AND THE PERIOD 2005-2010 IN MAINLAND CHINA. THE RESULTS INDICATE THE TOTAL VALUE-ADDED EFFECT IN MAINLAND CHINA IS LARGER THAN TAIWAN, WHEREAS THE MULTIPLIER OF AGRICULTURE LOSSES IN TAIWAN IS LARGER THAN MAINLAND CHINA. THIS INDICATES THAT THE LOSSES CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS ARE LARGER IN TAIWAN IS THAN IN MAINLAND CHINA.",""

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SECTOR POLICIES FOCUS EITHER ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE OR CONSUMPTION WHILE THE MAJORITY OF SECTORS ALONG THE TRANSMISSION WERE OVERLOOKED. THIS RESEARCH COMBINES INPUT-OUTPUT MODELLING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TO TRACK THE EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS AMONG THIRTY SECTORS OF THIRTY PROVINCES IN CHINA. BASED ON THE LARGE-DATA RESOLUTION NETWORK, A TWO-STEP NETWORK REDUCTION ALGORITHM IS USED TO EXTRACT THE BACKBONE OF THE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, NETWORK CENTRALITY METRICS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE USED TO ASSESS EACH INDIVIDUAL SECTOR'S ROLES, AND TO REVEAL THE CARBON COMMUNITIES WHERE SECTORS HAVE INTENSIVE EMISSION LINKS. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SECTORS WITH HIGH OUT-DEGREE, IN-DEGREE OR BETWEENNESS CAN ACT AS LEVERAGE POINTS FOR CARBON EMISSIONS MITIGATION. IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL ETS, THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE METALLURGY AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE HOTPOTS ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS PROVINCES AND THUS PROVINCIAL SPECIFIC TARGETED POLICIES SHOULD BE FORMED. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NINETEEN CARBON COMMUNITIES IN CHINA WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES, WHICH PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS' EXTERNAL COLLABORATION FOR SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS.",""

THE RESULTS SHOW REGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF CARBON PRICING ACROSS PROVINCES, I.E. POOR PROVINCES ARE AFFECTED MORE BY THE PRICE. CARBON PRICING ALSO SHOWS RURAL-URBAN REGRESSIVITY (I.E. RURAL HOUSEHOLDS ARE IMPACTED MORE HEAVILY THAN URBAN HOUSEHOLDS) IN MORE THAN HALF OF THE PROVINCES. WITHIN EACH SELECTED PROVINCE, CARBON PRICING HAS MOSTLY REGRESSIVE EFFECTS, I.E. POORER URBAN HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE AFFECTED THAN RICHER URBAN HOUSEHOLDS IN ALL PROVINCES AND POORER RURAL HOUSEHOLDS MORE THAN RICHER RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN ONE THIRD OF THE PROVINCES. WHEN LOOKING MORE SPECIFICALLY AT DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION, WE FIND THAT THE CARBON PRICING ON DOMESTIC FUELS GENERALLY SHOWS REGRESSIVITY, WHILE PRICING CARBON ON TRANSPORT FUELS SHOWS PROGRESSIVITY. IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF CARBON PRICING ON RESIDENTIAL DIRECT EXPENDITURES (MAINLY ON ELECTRICITY AND COAL) IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE REGIONAL REGRESSIVITY ACROSS PROVINCES.

THE CO2 EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS FOR 30 CHINESE PROVINCES DIFFER WIDELY, AND REMARKABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE CO2 EMISSIONS EMBODIED IN TRADE PER UNIT OF VALUE OF TRADE EXIST. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FINDING IS THAT IF PROVINCES TAKE BINDING COMMITMENTS AS A PART OF A COALITION, INSTEAD OF AS INDIVIDUAL PROVINCES, THEN THE IMPACTS OF TRADE CAN BE REDUCED. NOTABLY, HOWEVER, THE EXTENT OF REDUCTION IN A COALITION VARIES IN DIFFERENT PROVINCES.",""

MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE ADAPTIVE REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL TO CONSIDER BOTH THE SEVERITY OF INDIVIDUAL DROUGHT EVENTS AND THE PROPAGATION OF ECONOMIC LOSSES OVER TIME AND APPLIED TO A CASE STUDY OF SPAIN.

INDIRECT LOSSES WERE SHOWN TO INCREASE NONLINEARLY OVER TIME AND AS EMISSION SCENARIOS BECAME MORE SEVERE.
