DURING LA NINA EVENTS, THE PRECIPITATION OVER THE NE IS GENERALLY ABOVE AVERAGE. HOWEVER, DURING THE LAST LA NINA EVENT IN 2011-2012, THE NE WENT THROUGH ITS WORST DROUGHT IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. IN THIS STUDY, OBSERVATIONS AND NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS ARE USED TO DETERMINE WHAT MADE THE 2011-2012 EVENT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER EVENTS. WE FIND THAT EASTERN PACIFIC (CANONICAL) LA NINA EVENTS CAUSE A COOLING OF THE TROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC AND WARMING OF THE TROPICAL SOUTH ATLANTIC THAT LEAD TO A SOUTHWARD MIGRATION OF THE INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE, WHICH IN TURN BRINGS RAIN TO THE NE. ON THE OTHER HAND, LA NINA EVENTS WITH THE COOLING CONCENTRATED IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC CAUSE THE OPPOSITE MERIDIONAL SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) GRADIENT IN THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC, LEADING TO DROUGHTS OVER THE NE. THE 2011-2012 EVENT WAS OF THE LATTER TYPE. THIS STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE SIGN OF THE NE RAINFALL ANOMALY DURING ENSO EVENTS USING A SIMPLE SST INDEX. KEY POINTS",""

LID BMPS ARE MICROSCALE, DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SUCH AS VEGETATED SYSTEMS, PERVIOUS PAVEMENT, AND INFILTRATION TRENCHES TO CAPTURE, REDUCE, FILTER, AND SLOW STORM WATER RUNOFF. SOME BMPS MAY ENHANCE RECHARGE, WHICH HAS OFTEN BEEN CONSIDERED A SECONDARY MANAGEMENT BENEFIT. HERE WE REPORT RESULTS OF A FIELD AND HYDRUS-2D MODELING STUDY IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, USA TO QUANTIFY URBAN RECHARGE RATES, VOLUMES, AND EFFICIENCY BENEATH A LID BMP INFILTRATION TRENCH AND IRRIGATED LAWN CONSIDERING HISTORICAL EL NINO/SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO) VARIABILITY AND FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE USING SIMULATED PRECIPITATION FROM THE GEOPHYSICAL FLUID DYNAMIC LABORATORY (GFDL) A1F1 CLIMATE SCENARIO. WE FIND THAT IN SITU AND MODELING METHODS ARE COMPLEMENTARY, PARTICULARLY FOR SIMULATING HISTORICAL AND FUTURE RECHARGE SCENARIOS, AND THE IN SITU DATA ARE CRITICAL FOR ACCURATELY ESTIMATING RECHARGE UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS. OBSERVED (2011-2012) AND FUTURE (2099-2100) RECHARGE RATES BENEATH THE INFILTRATION TRENCH (1750-3710 MM YR(-1)) WERE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE GREATER THAN BENEATH THE IRRIGATED LAWN (130-730 MM YR(-1)). BENEATH THE INFILTRATION TRENCH, RECHARGE RATES RANGED FROM 1390 TO 5840 MM YR(-1) AND AVERAGED 3410 MM YR(-1) FOR EL NINO YEARS (1954-2012) AND FROM 1540 TO 3330 MM YR(-1) AND AVERAGED 2430 MM YR(-1) FOR LA NINA YEARS.

IN BOREAL SUMMER, THERE IS A STRONGLY CONFLUENT LOWER-LEVEL FLOW BETWEEN THE MONSOONAL WESTERLIES AND EASTERLY TRADES OVER THE INDO-NORTHWEST PACIFIC. THE EFFECT OF THIS BASIC STATE CONFLUENT FLOW ON THE AAC IS INVESTIGATED WITH ENERGETICS ANALYSIS AND NUMERICAL MODELING. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LOWER-LEVEL MEAN FLOW OVER THE INDO-NORTHWEST PACIFIC AIDS THE AAC DEVELOPMENT. SPECIFICALLY, THE CONVERSION OF KINETIC ENERGY FROM THE MEAN CONFLUENT FLOW TO PERTURBATIONS HELPS AMPLIFY EASTERLY ANOMALIES OVER THE INDO-NORTHWEST PACIFIC IN POST-EL NINO SUMMERS. THE ENHANCED EASTERLY WIND ANOMALIES PROVIDE A POSITIVE FEEDBACK ONTO THE AAC BY INDUCING SURFACE EKMAN DIVERGENCE TO SUPPRESS CONVECTION OVER THE NWP. MOREOVER, THE STRUCTURE OF THE OPTIMAL DIABATIC HEATING FOR THE AAC PATTERN IS DETERMINED USING A METHOD SIMILAR TO THE GREEN'S FUNCTION APPROACH. THE OPTIMAL FORCING FEATURES HEATING IN THE TROPICAL INDIAN OCEAN AND COOLING IN THE NWP. THIS SUGGESTS THAT BAROTROPIC ENERGY CONVERSION IN THE CONFLUENCE ZONE AND THE EL NINO-INDUCED POSITIVE (NEGATIVE) SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES OVER THE TIO (NWP) TOGETHER LEAD TO THE AAC DEVELOPMENT OVER THE INDO-NORTHWEST PACIFIC IN POST-EL NINO SUMMERS.",""

THE REANALYSIS DATASETS FROM ECMWF ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE ENERGETICS OF THE WH PATTERN IN THIS STUDY. THE COMPOSITE RESULTS BASED ON MONTHLY WH EVENTS REVEAL THAT THE KINETIC ENERGY (KE) ASSOCIATED WITH THE WH PATTERN IS MAINTAINED THROUGH THE BAROTROPIC CONVERSION FROM THE CLIMATOLOGICAL-MEAN WESTERLIES, MAINLY IN THE ATLANTIC JET EXIT REGIONS. THE KE COULD ALSO BE GAINED THROUGH THE BAROTROPIC FEEDBACK FORCING FROM TRANSIENT EDDIES. THE CORRESPONDING BAROCLINIC CONVERSION OF AVAILABLE POTENTIAL ENERGY (APE) FROM THE CLIMATOLOGICAL-MEAN STATE, WHICH CONTRIBUTES MOST EFFICIENTLY TO THE ENERGY MAINTENANCE OF THE WH PATTERN, IS OBVIOUS IN THE MIDDLE AND LOWER TROPOSPHERE, OWING TO THE THERMAL CONTRAST OF THE COLDER CONTINENT AND WARMER OCEAN OVER THE NORTH AMERICA-NORTH ATLANTIC SECTOR. THE BAROCLINIC CONVERSION ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEAT FLUX ON THE CLIMATOLOGICAL TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SOUTHWESTWARD-TILTING HEIGHT ANOMALIES FROM 850 TO 500 HPA.

SUCH MODELS ACCOUNT FOR NONSTATIONARITIES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY BUT AT THE PRICE OF ADDED COMPLEXITY. IT HAS BEEN DEBATED IF SUCH MODELS ARE WORTH DEVELOPING CONSIDERING THE INCREASE IN UNCERTAINTY INHERENT TO MORE COMPLEX MODELS. HOWEVER, THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED TO NONSTATIONARY MODELS IS RARELY STUDIED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO COMPARE THE UNCERTAINTIES IN STATIONARY AND NONSTATIONARY MODELS BASED ON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA. THE STUDY IS BASED ON OBSERVED RAINFALL DATA IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE) WHERE STRONG NONSTATIONARITIES WERE OBSERVED. IN THIS STUDY, A NONSTATIONARY FREQUENCY ANALYSIS INTRODUCING COVARIATES INTO THE DISTRIBUTION PARAMETERS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR TOTAL AND MAXIMUM ANNUAL RAINFALLS OBSERVED IN THE UAE. THE GENERALIZED EXTREME VALUE (GEV) DISTRIBUTION WAS USED TO MODEL ANNUAL MAXIMUM RAINFALLS AND THE GAMMA (G) DISTRIBUTION WAS USED TO MODEL TOTAL ANNUAL RAINFALLS. A NUMBER OF NONSTATIONARY MODELS, USING TIME AND CLIMATE INDICES AS COVARIATES, WERE DEVELOPED AND COMPARED TO CLASSICAL STATIONARY FREQUENCY ANALYSIS MODELS. TWO CLIMATE OSCILLATION PATTERNS HAVING STRONG IMPACTS ON PRECIPITATION IN THE UAE WERE SELECTED: THE OCEANIC NINO INDEX AND THE NORTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE INCLUSION OF A CLIMATE OSCILLATION INDEX GENERALLY IMPROVES THE FIT OF THE MODELS TO THE OBSERVED DATA AND THE INCLUSION OF TWO COVARIATES GENERALLY PROVIDES THE OVERALL BEST FITS. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATED QUANTILES WERE ASSESSED WITH CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) COMPUTED WITH THE PARAMETRIC BOOTSTRAP METHOD.

THE PRESENT MANUSCRIPT REVIEWS AND SUMMARIZES THE WORK MOSTLY CARRIED OUT IN OUR LAB ON THE WEATHER AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON INDIAN OCEAN, WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC AND INDIAN SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL (ISMR). HERE WE HAVE PROVIDED A SYNTHESIS ON THE INDIAN OCEAN MODES, PHYSICAL PROCESSES, BIASES IN MODELS, INTERACTION WITH PACIFIC, AND THEIR IMPACT ON ISMR AND ALSO UNRAVELED SOME IMPORTANT MECHANISMS. A NEW MODE OF VARIABILITY IN THE TROPICAL INDIAN OCEAN (TIO) SUBSURFACE TEMPERATURE WAS RECENTLY REPORTED AND WHICH IS FOUND TO HAVE STRONG IMPACT ON THE REGIONAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY. WE HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE FORMATION MECHANISM USING IN SITU OBSERVATION, REANALYSIS, OCEAN MODELS AND COUPLED OCEAN ATMOSPHERE MODELS. INTENSE BASIN WIDE TIO WARMING DURING EL NINO AND IOD CO-OCCURRENCE YEARS AND THE DYNAMIC PROCESSES BEHIND MAINTAINING THIS WARMING ARE EXPLORED. WE HAVE SHOWN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT A PRONOUNCED UP-WESTWARD PROPAGATION OF SUBSURFACE WARMING ALONG THE SLOPING MEAN THERMOCLINE AND WESTWARD PROPAGATION OF BARRIER LAYERS CORROBORATED BY DOWNWELLING ROSSBY WAVES EXCITED BY EQUATORIAL ZONAL WIND ANOMALIES DURING EL NIO-IOD CO-OCCURRING YEARS. A ROBUST POSITIVE FEEDBACK BETWEEN SST WARMING AND BARRIER LAYER DEVELOPMENT LEAD TO CHANGES IN AIR-SEA INTERACTIONS OVER THE WESTERN TIO, WHICH IS A REGION CRUCIAL FOR ISMR PREDICTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF MJO. SEVERAL SCIENCE QUESTIONS LEADING TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ENSO AND NON-ENSO TELECONNECTIONS TO ISMR WITH MORE EMPHASIS ON DECAY PHASE OF EL NINO AND THE INDO-WESTERN PACIFIC OCEAN CAPACITOR (IPOC) MODE AND PACIFIC JAPAN (PJ) PATTERN ARE ADDRESSED. WE HAVE ALSO EXPLORED THE INFLUENCE OF THE PACIFIC-JAPAN PATTERN (PJ) ON ISMR AND PROPOSED THE POSSIBLE PHYSICAL LINKAGES THROUGH COUPLED (OCEAN-ATMOSPHERIC) AND UNCOUPLED (ATMOSPHERIC) PATHWAYS AND SHOWED THAT IN RESPONSE TO THE PJ PATTERN THE RAINFALL OVER THE SOUTHERN INDIA ENHANCES DUE TO NORTHWESTWARD PROPAGATING ROSSBY WAVES CORROBORATED BY LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE IN THE SOUTHERN FLANK OF WESTWARD EXTENDED WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC (WNP) ANTICYCLONE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS FOUND THAT WESTWARD PROPAGATING ATMOSPHERIC COLD ROSSBY WAVE AS A RESPONSE TO SUPPRESSED CONVECTION OVER THE WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC REGION INDUCED MOISTURE DIVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH IPOC MODE AND DOWNWARD MOTION PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MAINTAINING NEGATIVE RAINFALL ANOMALIES OVER THE MONSOON TROUGH REGION. THE COUPLED INTERACTION BETWEEN INDIAN OCEAN BASIN MODE, ASYMMETRIC MODE IN THE TIO, NORTHWEST PACIFIC CIRCULATION ETC. PAVED WAY FOR RENEWED UNDERSTANDING OF MONSOON TELECONNECTIONS. WE HAVE CARRIED OUT SEVERAL OCEAN MODEL AND COUPLED MODEL SIMULATIONS AND SENSITIVITY EXPERIMENTS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESSES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INDIAN OCEAN VARIABILITY, THE ISMR VARIABILITY AND THE TELECONNECTIONS. THE EFFORTS WERE ALSO MADE TO UNDERSTAND THE OCEAN BIASES IN THE COUPLED MODEL USED FOR MONSOON FORECAST IN INDIA. WHILE EXAMINING OCEAN STATE IN COUPLED MODELS, WE NOTED THAT THEY EXHIBIT TOO MUCH SURFACE COOLING AND SUBSURFACE WARMING OVER THE TIO. OUR WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME REVEALED THAT THE ENHANCED VERTICAL MIXING BY STRONG VERTICAL SHEAR OF HORIZONTAL CURRENTS IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR TIO SUBSURFACE WARMING AND FEEDS BACK TO SURFACE COOLING IN COUPLED MODELS. THE MISREPRESENTATION OF ENSO-MONSOON TELECONNECTION AND ENSO-INDIAN OCEAN TELECONNECTION IN THE MONSOON FORECAST MODEL IS ALSO ADDRESSED IN DETAIL WITH A VIEW TO IMPROVE THE FORECASTING SYSTEM. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST OF THE MODELS FAILED TO REPRESENT ENSO-MONSOON TELECONNECTIONS, MAINLY DUE TO UNREALISTIC WESTWARD EXTENSION OF SST WARMING/COOLING ASSOCIATED WITH EL NINO/LA NINA, CHANGES IN WNP CIRCULATION AND TIO SST RESPONSE. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS CLIMATE VARIABILITY WOULD BE USEFUL TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN COUPLED MODELS AND IMPROVISATIONS. DEVELOPING A PREDICTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF REGIONAL CLIMATE INCLUDING THE NEW MODES OF VARIABILITY IS A GRAND CHALLENGE FOR RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND OUR TWO DECADES OF CONTRIBUTIONS WERE NAILING TOWARDS THESE ASPECTS.",""

THE CLUSTER ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE STUDY REGION CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO SIX HOMOGENEOUS SUB-REGIONS WHERE THE DROUGHT CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR TEMPORAL EVOLUTIONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. THE TREND TEST AND PERIODICITY ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT GUIZHOU PROVINCE EXPERIENCED A DRIER TREND, WHICH WAS MOST SIGNIFICANT IN THE WESTERN PARTS OF THE REGION. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INTENSIFIED DROUGHT SEVERITY WAS NOT ALWAYS COINCIDENT WITH THE DRIER TREND BUT RELIED ON THE OCCURRENCE OF EXTREME DROUGHT EVENTS. THE TRENDS OF DRIER CLIMATE AND DROUGHT SEVERITY WERE HIGHLY COINCIDENT WITH THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE DROUGHT PERIODICITIES, WHICH WERE SHORTENED FROM 1-4 YEARS TO LESS THAN ONE YEAR. THE SHORTENED DROUGHT PERIODICITY WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED PRINCIPALLY WITH A SHIFT OF THE LARGE-SCALE DOMINANT CLIMATE INDICES FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION TO THE INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE AFTER THE LATE 1970S, AND VARIATIONS OF THE EXTREME DROUGHT EVENTS WERE MOSTLY RELATED TO NINO34 IN THE STUDY REGION.",""

WE EXAMINED CLIMATIC TELECONNECTIONS BETWEEN LARGE-SCALE CLIMATE INDICES AND TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY OVER SOUTH KOREA. TO DO THIS, WE CALCULATED NOT ONLY LEADING PATTERNS OF OBSERVED MONTHLY MEAN AND EXTREME TEMPERATURE THROUGH AN EMPIRICAL ORTHOGONAL TELECONNECTION (EOT) DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUE BUT ALSO STATISTICAL CORRELATIONS ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING CROSS-CORRELATION AND LAG REGRESSION ANALYSES FOR THE LEADING MODES AND GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION DATASET. AS A RESULT, THE SPATIAL PATTERN OF THE LEADING EOT MODES FOR MEAN (EXTREME HIGH) TEMPERATURE REPRESENTS AN EASTERN (SOUTHERN) COASTAL MODE FOR BOREAL SUMMER AND A NORTHERN (MIDDLE) INLAND MODE IN BOREAL WINTER, WHILE EXTREME LOW EOTS EXHIBIT A NORTHERN INLAND MODE IN SUMMER AND A WESTERN COASTAL MODE IN WINTER. THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE LEADING EOT MODES EXHIBITS A MOSTLY INCREASING TREND AND AN INTERDECADAL OSCILLATION. THE LEADING EOT MODES OF MEAN TEMPERATURE EXPLAIN MORE VARIANCE THAN THOSE OF EXTREME TEMPERATURE DURING WARM AND COLD SEASONS. THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATE THAT TROPICAL ENSO FORCING HAS A COHERENT ASSOCIATION WITH AUGUST AND DECEMBER TEMPERATURE PATTERNS, WHILE THE INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE IS IDENTIFIED AS A DRIVER FOR TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY DURING FALL SEASON. THE MONSOON CIRCULATION OVER THE WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC ALSO EXHIBITS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH THE DECEMBER TEMPERATURE EOTS.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CO2 EMISSIONS OF THE PLEEZ ARE NOT PERFORMING EFFICIENTLY AND THE CO2 EMISSIONS EFFICIENCY REMAINS AT A VERY LOW LEVEL WITH AN AVERAGE VALUE OF 0.279. MEANWHILE, THE SHADOW PRICES OF CO2 EMISSIONS ARE CALCULATED, WITH A MEAN VALUE OF 11.867 YUAN PER TON, WHICH IS RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED WITH OTHER PREVIOUS STUDIES OF DIFFERENT REGIONS OR INDUSTRY AND INDICATE THAT CARBON EMISSIONS ARE NOT STRICTLY REGULATED.

OGCM EXPERIMENTS REVEAL THAT PACIFIC FORCING THROUGH THE INDONESIAN THROUGHFLOW EXPLAINS <20\% OF THE TOTAL SST VARIABILITY, AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF LOCAL WIND STRESS IS ALSO SMALL. THESE WIND-FORCED ANOMALIES MAINLY OCCUR NEAR THE WESTERN AUSTRALIAN COAST. THE MAJORITY OF SST VARIABILITY IS ATTRIBUTED TO SURFACE HEAT FLUXES. THE REDUCED UPWARD TURBULENT HEAT FLUX (Q(T); LATENT PLUS SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX), OWING TO DECREASED WIND SPEED AND ANOMALOUS WARM, MOIST AIR ADVECTION, IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE GROWTH OF WARM SST ANOMALIES (SSTAS).

THE CHANGE CHARACTERISTICS OF PRECIPITATION AND EXTREME PRECIPITATION INDICES WERE INVESTIGATED USING MANN-KENDALL TEST, SPEARMAN'S RANK CORRELATION AND WAVELET ANALYSIS. THE CROSS WAVELET TRANSFORM AND WAVELET COHERENCE WERE USED TO EXPLORE THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE PRECIPITATION AND LARGE-SCALE TELECONNECTION INDICES SUCH AS ARCTIC OSCILLATION (AO), SOUTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX (SOI), EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO) AND SUNSPOT.

IN THIS RESEARCH, HOW CLIMATE CHANGE MAY AFFECT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY VIA REDUCING AVAILABLE WATER RESOURCES IN SOME REGIONS IS INVESTIGATED BASED ON A MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT (MRIO) MODEL THAT PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC STRUCTURE. KEY NATION SECTORS WITH THE GREATEST VIRTUAL WATER SCARCITY RISK (VWSR) EXPORTS ARE IDENTIFIED UNDER TWO CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS, INCLUDING THE AGRICULTURE SECTORS IN SYRIA, PAKISTAN, KAZAKHSTAN, INDIA, UZBEKISTAN, IRAN, AND CHINA.

ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH COMPARING THE CHANGE OF RANKINGS OF VWSR IMPORTS, VWSR EXPORTS, AND LWSRS AT COUNTRY AND SECTOR LEVEL, THE RANKINGS OF VWSR EXPORTS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE TO LWSRS, WHILE THE RANKINGS OF VWSR IMPORTS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM LWSRS. THE EVALUATION DEMONSTRATES THAT NATIONS SHOULD COOPERATIVELY MANAGE WATER RESOURCES AND BE AWARE OF THE TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUAL WATER SCARCITY RISK THROUGH INTERNATIONAL TRADE UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. MOREOVER, NATION-SECTORS WITH HIGH VWSR IMPORTS MAY REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON WATER-INTENSIVE PRODUCTS AND DIVERSIFY IMPORTING SOURCES, AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ENCOURAGE RESIDENTS TO CHANGE CONSUMPTION PATTERNS.

THIS CHANGE ARISES PARTLY BECAUSE ENSO BECOMES LESS VARIABLE AND PARTLY BECAUSE THE ENSO TELECONNECTION PATTERN EXPANDS INTO THE ATLANTIC. OVER LAND, THE LARGEST CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE PREDICTABILITY OCCURS IN THE TROPICS AND IS PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO A DECREASE IN ENSO VARIABILITY. THE SOUTHERN PENINSULA OF AFRICA AND NORTHEAST SOUTH AMERICA ARE PREDICTED TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DRYING IN A FUTURE CLIMATE, WHICH DECREASES THE EFFECTIVE HEAT CAPACITY AND MEMORY, AND HENCE INCREASES VARIANCE INDEPENDENTLY OF ENSO CHANGES. EXTRATROPICAL LAND AREAS EXPERIENCE ENHANCED PRECIPITATION IN A FUTURE CLIMATE, WHICH DECREASES TEMPERATURE VARIANCE BY THE SAME MECHANISM. FINALLY, THE MODEL PREDICTS THAT SURFACE TEMPERATURES NEAR THE POLES WILL BECOME MORE PREDICTABLE AND LESS VARIABLE IN A FUTURE CLIMATE, PRIMARILY BECAUSE MELTING SEA ICE EXPOSES THE UNDERLYING SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE, WHICH IS MORE PREDICTABLE OWING TO ITS LONGER TIME SCALE.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE CAUSES OF INCREASING RAINFALL OVER NWA AND FOCUSES ON INFLUENCES ORIGINATING IN THE MIDDLE TO HIGH LATITUDES, I.E., SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN CLIMATE VARIABILITY. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT VARIATIONS IN SUMMER RAINFALL OVER NWA ARE RELATED TO THE CONCURRENT STRENGTH OF THE MASCARENE HIGH. IN YEARS WITH A STRONG MASCARENE HIGH IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE, THE CYCLONIC VORTICITY OVER NWA IS ENHANCED, AND MORE MOISTURE IS TRANSPORTED INTO NWA. SIMULTANEOUSLY, AN ANOMALOUS VERTICAL CLOSED CIRCULATION FORMS, WITH AN ASCENDING BRANCH OVER NWA AND SUBSIDENCE OVER THE REGION OCCUPIED BY THE MASCARENE HIGH. AS FOR THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE, THE MASCARENE HIGH IS RELATED TO A TELECONNECTION WAVE TRAIN FROM THE SOUTHERN INDIAN OCEAN TO NWA, WHICH IN TURN INFLUENCES THE CIRCULATION OVER NWA. THIS SETTING IS FAVORABLE FOR ENHANCED RAINFALL OVER NWA. ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSE OF VARIATIONS IN THE MASCARENE HIGH INDICATES THAT UNDERLYING EXTERNAL FORCING OF THE HIGH BY, FOR EXAMPLE, SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) HAS INTENSIFIED, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE (SAM) DURING THE PRECEDING SPRING.

THE ONLY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FOUR INTEGRATIONS ARE THE FREQUENCY OF COUPLING BETWEEN THE OCEAN AND ATMOSPHERE FOR THE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) PARAMETER (2 VS. 24 H COUPLING) AND/OR THE VERTICAL OCEANIC RESOLUTION (31 VS. 301 LEVELS) IN THE CGCM. ALTHOUGH THE SUMMER MEAN TROPICAL CLIMATE IS REASONABLY WELL CAPTURED WITH ALL THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THE CGCM AND IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED BY CHANGING THE FREQUENCY OF SST COUPLING FROM ONCE TO TWELVE PER DAY, THE ISM-ENSO TELECONNECTIONS ARE RATHER POORLY SIMULATED IN THE TWO SIMULATIONS IN WHICH SST IS EXCHANGED ONLY ONCE PER DAY, INDEPENDENTLY OF THE VERTICAL OCEANIC RESOLUTION USED IN THE CGCM. SURPRISINGLY, WHEN 2 H SST COUPLING IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE CGCM, THE ISM-ENSO TELECONNECTION IS BETTER SIMULATED, PARTICULARLY, THE COMPLEX LEAD-LAG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE TWO PHENOMENA, IN WHICH A WEAK ISM OCCURS DURING THE DEVELOPING PHASE OF AN EL NIO EVENT IN THE PACIFIC, ARE CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE OBSERVED ONES. EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED TO SHOW THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MODEL'S EL NIO WHICH HAS A MORE REALISTIC EVOLUTION IN ITS DEVELOPING AND DECAYING PHASES, A STRONGER AMPLITUDE AND A SHIFT TO LOWER FREQUENCIES WHEN A 2-HOURLY SST COUPLING STRATEGY IS IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE BASIC STATE OF THE CGCM. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN ENSO VARIABILITY, THE LEAD RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INDO-PACIFIC SSTS AND ISM RAINFALL RESEMBLE THE OBSERVED PATTERNS MORE CLOSELY, THE ISM-ENSO TELECONNECTION IS STRENGTHENED DURING BOREAL SUMMER AND ISM RAINFALL POWER SPECTRUM IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH OBSERVATIONS.

THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE SIMULATED CLIMATE RESPONSE AT MIDDLE AND HIGH LATITUDES IS INTERNAL ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANNULAR MODES OF CIRCULATION VARIABILITY. COUPLED OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE VARIABILITY PLAYS A DOMINANT ROLE IN THE TROPICS, WITH ATTENDANT EFFECTS AT HIGHER LATITUDES VIA ATMOSPHERIC TELECONNECTIONS. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FORCED RESPONSE ARE GENERALLY LARGER FOR SEA LEVEL PRESSURE THAN PRECIPITATION, AND SMALLEST FOR AIR TEMPERATURE.

THE SEASONAL PREDICTION SKILL FOR THE NH 200-HPA GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT BASICALLY COMES FROM THE COUPLED MODELS' ABILITY IN PREDICTING THE FIRST TWO EMPIRICAL ORTHOGONAL FUNCTION (EOF) MODES OF INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY, BECAUSE THE MODELS CANNOT REPLICATE THE RESIDUAL HIGHER MODES.

A PRE-INDUSTRIAL CONTROL RUN AND SCENARIO RUNS FOR THE 4TH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) ARE CONSIDERED. TIBETAN PLATEAU PRECIPITATION IN MONTHS OF WETNESS AND DROUGHT IS RELATED TO ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION ANOMALIES IN THE NORTH-ATLANTIC/EUROPEAN SECTOR AND TO SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES IN THE TROPICS. DROUGHT ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU IS ASSOCIATED WITH A PRONOUNCED WAVE TRAIN BRIDGING EURASIA FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC TO ASIA. INCREASED TRANSIENT EDDY ACTIVITY IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC STORM TRACK HAS A MORE SOUTH-WEST TO NORTH-EAST ORIENTATION. THIS SUPPORTS A HIGH PRESSURE ANOMALY OVER THE EASTERN NORTH ATLANTIC AND SCANDINAVIA WHICH EXCITES A CROSS EURASIAN WAVE TRAIN REDUCING THE MOISTURE INFLOW TO THE TIBETAN PLATEAU FROM THE ARABIAN SEA. A CONCURRENT WARMING IN THE TROPICAL INDIAN OCEAN INCREASES THE LOW LEVEL MONSOONAL WESTERLIES DEVIATING THE MOISTURE TRANSPORT FROM THE BAY OF BENGAL TOWARDS THE INDOCHINESE PENINSULA AND THE PHILIPPINES. WETNESS ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU IS DOMINATED BY A COOLING IN THE TROPICAL OCEANS, WHEREAS ATMOSPHERIC FLOW IS PREDOMINANTLY ZONAL IN THE EXTRATROPICS OF NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. THUS, MOISTURE INFLOW CAN REACH THE TIBETAN PLATEAU VIA THE ARABIAN SEA, THE BAY OF BENGAL AND THE MID-LATITUDE WESTERLIES. FUTURE SCENARIOS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE OF ATMOSPHERIC FLOW COMPOSITES FOR WETNESS AND DRYNESS; THE TIBETAN PLATEAU DROUGHTS INCREASE BY 10\% FOR AN A1B-SCENARIO, WHILE EXTREME WET SUMMER MONTHS ARE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 1\%.

IN OUR COUPLED CONTROL INTEGRATION, AN OCEANIC OSCILLATION OF A PERIOD OF AROUND 20 YEARS IS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABILITY OF THE METIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION AND IS MANIFESTED BY SURFACE ANOMALIES OF TEMPERATURE AND SALINITY. ON SUCH TIMESCALES THE OCEANIC OSCILLATION IS ABLE TO IMPRINT ITSELF ON THE ATMOSPHERE, WHICH THEN COVATIES WITH THE OCEAN AT THE OSCILLATION PERIOD. THE ESSENTIALLY SLAVED ATMOSPHERIC PATTERN HELPS MAINTAIN THE OCEANIC OSCILLATION BY PROVIDING LARGE-SCALE ANOMALOUS HEAT FLUXES, SO CATALYZING THE OSCILLATION. THAT IS TO SAY, BECAUSE THE ATMOSPHERE COVARIES WITH THE OCEAN THE DAMPING FELT BY THE OCEAN IS LESS THAN WHAT WOULD BE FELT WITH A FIXED ATMOSPHERE, SO BROADENING THE PARAMETER REGIME OVER WHICH SUCH VARIABILITY OCCURS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRESENCE OF AN ATMOSPHERE, THE PERIOD AND AMPLITUDE OF THE OSCILLATION ARE FOUND TO BE INFLUENCED BOTH BY THE OCEANIC VERTICAL DIFFUSIVITY KAPPA(V), BY GEOMETRICAL FACTORS, AND BY THE PRESENCE OF STOCHASTIC HEAT FLUXES. IN GENERAL, OSCILLATIONS OCCUR MOST READILY FOR LARGE VALUES OF KAPPA(V), WHEN THE MEAN STATE OF THE OCEAN IS CHARACTERIZED BY A STRONG MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION. IF KAPPA(V) IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG, THE OCEAN WILL OSCILLATE EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF A DYNAMICAL ATMOSPHERE.

TEMPERATURE INDICES INDICATE STRONG WARMING WITH INCREASES IN THE FREQUENCY OF WARM EVENTS (E.G., WARM NIGHTS AND WARM SUMMER DAYS) AND DECREASES IN THE FREQUENCY OF COLD EVENTS (E.G., ICE DAYS, FROST DAYS, AND THE COLD SPELL DURATION INDICATOR). THE STRONGEST WARMING IS EXHIBITED IN THE DECREASE IN FROST DAYS AND THE INCREASE IN GROWING SEASON LENGTH. ALTHOUGH MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES INDICES SHOWED STRONG WARMING TRENDS OVER THE PERIOD 1893-1950, SUBSEQUENT TRENDS SHOW LITTLE CHANGE AND COOLING. FEW SIGNIFICANT TRENDS WERE PRESENT IN THE PRECIPITATION INDICES; HOWEVER, THEY DISPLAYED A TENDENCY TOWARD WETTER CONDITIONS. A STEPWISE MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SOME OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE 27 INDICES FROM 1951 TO 2002 WAS EXPLAINED BY THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION, PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION, AND PACIFIC NORTH AMERICAN PATTERN.

FA OBJECTIVELY GROUPS GRID POINTS WITH COMMON TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF SOLAR RADIATION, IDENTIFYING AREAS WITH CHARACTERISTIC SOLAR RADIATION VARIABILITY AND REVEALING TELECONNECTION PATTERNS. THE GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED DSR EXHIBITS STRONG VARIABILITY AND CAN BE REPRESENTED BY ABOUT 30 FACTORS (SUB-AREAS) EXPLAINING APPROXIMATELY 85\% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCE. THE MAIN FACTORS ARE LOCATED IN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC (EL NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION), THE NORTHERN PACIFIC (ALEUTIAN LOW), DESERT AREAS (AFRICA, MIDDLE EAST, AND AUSTRALIA), AND OCEANIC AREAS (STORM TRACK ZONE AROUND 60 S). FURTHERMORE, SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE TELECONNECTED INDICATING COMMON DSR VARIABILITY IN REMOTE PLACES OF THE EARTH.

THE RESULTS REPORTED HERE INDICATE NO SUBSTANTIAL LONG-TERM WARMING OR PRECIPITATION TRENDS IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND SUGGEST A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COOL SEASON (NOVEMBER-APRIL) TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION AND THE NAO. MORE IMPORTANTLY, TRENDS IN STREAM SALAMANDER ABUNDANCE ARE BEST EXPLAINED BY VARIATION IN THE NAO AS SALAMANDERS ARE MOST PLENTIFUL DURING THE WARMER, WETTER PHASES.",""

DURING THE POSTREGIME SHIFT EPOCH, THE EL NINO TELECONNECTION EXCITES DOWNWELLING ROSSBY WAVES IN THE SOUTH 110 BY ANTICYCLONIC WIND CURLS. THESE ROSSBY WAVES PROPAGATE SLOWLY WESTWARD, CAUSING PERSISTENT SST WARMING OVER THE THERMOCLINE RIDGE IN THE SOUTHWEST TIO. THE OCEAN WARMING INDUCES AN ANTISYMMETRIC WIND PATTERN ACROSS THE EQUATOR, AND THE ANOMALOUS NORTHEASTERLIES CAUSE THE NORTH INDIAN OCEAN TO WARM THROUGH JJA(1) BY REDUCING THE SOUTHWESTERLY MONSOON WINDS.

BUILDING UPON THE RECENT WORK OF ZENG (ENVIRON RES LETT 3:014002, 2008), HERE WE PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR AN INFLUENCE ON AMAZON RAINFALL FROM THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC OCEAN. THE STRENGTH OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC INFLUENCE IS FOUND TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE BETTER-KNOWN PACIFIC ENSO CONNECTION. THE TROPICAL SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN ALSO SHOWS SOME INFLUENCE DURING THE WET-TO-DRY SEASON TRANSITION PERIOD. THE ATLANTIC INFLUENCE IS THROUGH CHANGES IN THE NORTH-SOUTH DIVERGENT CIRCULATION AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE ITCZ FOLLOWING WARM SST. THEREFORE, IT IS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AMAZON BASIN DURING THE AMAZON'S DRY SEASON (JULY-OCTOBER). IN CONTRAST, THE ENSO RELATED TELECONNECTION IS THROUGH ANOMALOUS EAST-WEST WALKER CIRCULATION WITH LARGELY CONCENTRATED IN THE EASTERN (LOWER) AMAZON. THIS ENSO CONNECTION IS SEASONALLY LOCKED TO BOREAL WINTER. A COMPLICATION DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF ENSO ON ATLANTIC SST CAUSES AN APPARENT NORTH ATLANTIC SST LAG OF AMAZON RAINFALL. REMOVING ENSO FROM NORTH ATLANTIC SST VIA LINEAR REGRESSION RESOLVES THIS CAUSALITY PROBLEM IN THAT THE RESIDUAL ATLANTIC VARIABILITY CORRELATES WELL AND IS IN PHASE WITH THE AMAZON RAINFALL.

BOTH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL DIABATIC HEATING ARE EXAMINED. THE ROSSBY WAVE SOURCES IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE PNA ARE ALSO DIAGNOSED. THE PNA-RELATED HEATING IS CONFINED OUTSIDE THE TROPICS AND IS DOMINATED BY ANOMALIES IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC, WITH A NORTH-SOUTH DIPOLE STRUCTURE IN MID-LATITUDES AND THE NORTHERN SUBTROPICS. THE HEATING ANOMALIES CHANGE SIGN WITH HEIGHT IN MID-LATITUDES BUT HAVE THE SAME SIGN THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE IN THE NORTHERN SUBTROPICS. RELATIVELY WEAK HEATING ANOMALIES ALSO APPEAR IN MID-LATITUDES, DOWNSTREAM OF THE HEATING DIPOLE OVER NORTH AMERICA AND THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. THE HEATING ANOMALIES ARE LARGELY SUPPORTED BY THE ADVECTIONS RELATED TO THE MEAN STATE THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE, AND PARTIALLY DAMPED BY THE ADVECTIONS RELATED TO THE EDDY EFFECT, PARTICULARLY AT THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE OVER THE NORTH PACIFIC. BROADLY SIMILAR PATTERNS ARE SEEN FROM THE NCEP-NCAR AND ERA-40 REANALYSES. YET ANOMALOUS HEATING CENTERS ARE GENERALLY LOCATED AT RELATIVELY LOWER TROPOSPHERE FOR THE ERA-40 WITH RESPECT TO THE NCEP-NCAR. THE TROPICAL HEATING ANOMALIES ARE RATHER WEAK, REMARKABLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE RELATED TO ENSO VARIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE ROSSBY WAVE SOURCE COLLOCATES WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC DIABATIC FORCING IN THE MID-HIGH LATITUDES OVER THE PNA SECTOR, AND SHOWS NO FORCING SOURCE IN THE TROPICS. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE POSSIBLE FORCING IN THE MID-HIGH LATITUDES, REGARDLESS OF TROPICAL HEATING FOR THE PNA TELECONNECTION. THE MODELED HEATING AND WAVE FORCING ANOMALIES IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MODELED PNA COMPARE REASONABLY WELL WITH THE REANALYSIS-BASED ESTIMATES, INCREASING CONFIDENCE IN THE OBSERVATIONAL RESULTS. THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE PNA ON ENSO FROM THE DIABATIC HEATING POINT OF VIEW.",""

THESE AMOC STATES SUGGEST THE EXISTENCE OF A FRESHWATER THRESHOLD FOR WHICH THE AMOC COLLAPSES. A WEAK (18 TO 15 SV) AMOC DECREASE RESULTS IN A NORTH ATLANTIC AND EUROPEAN COOLING. THIS COOLING IS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, WITH EVEN A SLIGHT WARMING OVER THE NORWEGIAN SEA. CONVECTION IN THIS AREA IS ACTIVE IN BOTH EXPERIMENTS, BUT SURPRISINGLY STRONGER IN THE 15 SV SIMULATION, WHICH APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO INTERACTIONS WITH THE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND SEA-ICE COVER. FAR FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC, THE CLIMATIC RESPONSE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE CLIMATE DIFFERENCES FOR AN AMOC COLLAPSE (15 TO 2 SV) ARE MUCH LARGER AND OF GLOBAL EXTENT. THE TIMING OF THE CLIMATE RESPONSE TO THIS AMOC COLLAPSE SUGGESTS TELECONNECTION MECHANISMS. OUR ANALYSES FOCUS ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND SURROUNDING REGIONS, THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC AND THE INDIAN MONSOON REGION. THE NORTH ATLANTIC COOLING ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMOC COLLAPSE INDUCES A CYCLONIC ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION ANOMALY CENTRED OVER THIS REGION, WHICH MODULATES THE EASTWARD ADVECTION OF COLD AIR OVER THE EURASIAN CONTINENT. THIS CAN EXPLAIN WHY THE COOLING IS NOT AS STRONG OVER WESTERN EUROPE AS OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC. IN THE TROPICS, THE SOUTHWARD SHIFT OF THE INTER-TROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE APPEARS TO BE STRONGEST OVER THE ATLANTIC AND EASTERN PACIFIC AND RESULTS FROM AN ADJUSTMENT OF THE ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC HEAT TRANSPORTS. FINALLY, THE INDIAN MONSOON WEAKENING APPEARS TO BE CONNECTED TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC COOLING VIA THAT OF THE TROPOSPHERE OVER EURASIA.

FIRST, THE PDV CIRCULATION PATTERN IS SHIFTED WESTWARD BY ABOUT 20 AND IS LESS ZONALLY EXTENDED THAN THAT FOR ENSO. THE WESTWARD SHIFT OF THE PDV WAVE TRAIN PRODUCES A DIFFERENT NORTH AMERICAN TELECONNECTION PATTERN THAT IS MORE WEST-EAST ORIENTED. THE LACK OF A STRONG PDV SURFACE TEMPERATURE (ST) SIGNAL IN THE WEST EQUATORIAL PACIFIC AND THE RELATIVELY STRONG ST SIGNAL IN THE SUBTROPICAL REGIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AN ATMOSPHERIC OVERTURNING CIRCULATION RESPONSE THAT DIFFERS FROM THE ONE ASSOCIATED WITH ENSO.

THE FIRST MODE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TURNABOUT OF WARMING TO COOLING IN THE EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO), WHEREAS THE SECOND MODE LEADS THE WARMING/COOLING BY ABOUT 1 YEAR, SIGNALING PRECURSORY CONDITIONS FOR ENSO. THE FIRST MODE HAS A STRONG BIENNIAL TENDENCY AND REFLECTS THE TROPICAL BIENNIAL OSCILLATION (MEEHL IN J CLIM 6:31-41, 1993). WE SHOW THAT THE MME 1-MONTH LEAD PREDICTION OF THE SEASONAL PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES CAPTURES THE FIRST TWO LEADING MODES OF VARIABILITY WITH HIGH FIDELITY IN TERMS OF SEASONALLY EVOLVING SPATIAL PATTERNS AND YEAR-TO-YEAR TEMPORAL VARIATIONS, AS WELL AS THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ENSO. THE MME SHOWS A POTENTIAL TO CAPTURE THE PRECURSORS OF ENSO IN THE SECOND MODE ABOUT FIVE SEASONS PRIOR TO THE MATURATION OF A STRONG EL NINO. HOWEVER, THE MME UNDERESTIMATES THE TOTAL VARIANCES OF THE TWO MODES AND THE BIENNIAL TENDENCY OF THE FIRST MODE. THE MODELS HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN CAPTURING PRECIPITATION OVER THE MARITIME CONTINENT AND THE WALKER-TYPE TELECONNECTION IN THE DECAYING PHASE OF ENSO, WHICH MAY CONTRIBUTE IN PART TO A MONSOON ``SPRING PREDICTION BARRIER'' (SPB). THE NCEP/CFS MODEL HINDCAST RESULTS SHOW THAT, AS THE LEAD TIME INCREASES, THE FRACTIONAL VARIANCE OF THE FIRST MODE INCREASES, SUGGESTING THAT THE LONG-LEAD PREDICTABILITY OF A-AM RAINFALL COMES PRIMARILY FROM ENSO PREDICTABILITY. IN THE CFS MODEL, THE CORRELATION SKILL FOR THE FIRST PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REMAINS ABOUT 0.9 UP TO 6 MONTHS BEFORE IT DROPS RAPIDLY, BUT FOR THE SPATIAL PATTERN IT EXHIBITS A DROP ACROSS THE BOREAL SPRING. THIS STUDY UNCOVERED TWO SURPRISING FINDINGS. FIRST, THE COUPLED MODELS' MME PREDICTIONS CAPTURE THE FIRST TWO LEADING MODES OF PRECIPITATION VARIABILITY BETTER THAN THOSE CAPTURED BY THE ERA-40 AND NCEP-2 REANALYSIS DATASETS, SUGGESTING THAT TREATING THE ATMOSPHERE AS A SLAVE MAY BE INHERENTLY UNABLE TO SIMULATE SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL VARIATIONS IN THE HEAVILY PRECIPITATING REGIONS (WANG ET AL. IN J CLIM 17:803-818, 2004). IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE REANALYSIS SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT WITH COUPLED ATMOSPHERE AND OCEAN MODELS. SECOND, WHILE THE MME IN GENERAL BETTER THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL MODELS, THE CFS ENSEMBLE HINDCAST OUTPERFORMS THE MME IN TERMS OF THE BIENNIAL TENDENCY AND THE AMPLITUDE OF THE ANOMALIES, SUGGESTING THAT THE IMPROVED SKILL OF MME PREDICTION IS AT THE EXPENSE OF OVERESTIMATING THE FRACTIONAL VARIANCE OF THE LEADING MODE.

THE BASIC QUESTION IS AS TO WHAT EXTENT VARIOUS STATE-OF-THE-ART CLIMATE MODELS AGREE IN PREDICTING CHANGES IN THE MAIN FEATURES OF EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO) AND THE MONSOON CLIMATES IN SOUTH ASIA AND WEST AFRICA. THE INDIVIDUAL MODEL RUNS ARE COMPARED WITH OBSERVATIONAL DATA IN ORDER TO JUDGE WHETHER THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ENSO ARE WELL REPRODUCED. THE MODEL EXPERIMENTS CAN BE GROUPED INTO MULTI-MODEL ENSEMBLES. THUS, CLIMATE CHANGE SIGNALS IN THE CLASSICAL INDEX TIME SERIES, IN THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS AND IN THE TIME SERIES OF INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY CAN BE EVALUATED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF INTERNAL VARIABILITY AND MODEL UNCERTAINTY. THERE ARE LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL MODEL PREDICTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY, ESPECIALLY IN TENUS OF MONSOON RAINFALL AND THE SOUTHERN OSCILLATION INDEX (SOI).

HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE BARELY EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF NATURAL VARIABILITY AND THE SYSTEMATIC INTERMODEL VARIATIONS ARE LARGER THAN THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT IPCC SCENARIOS. NONETHELESS, THERE IS ONE PROMINENT CLIMATE CHANGE SIGNAL, WHICH STANDS OUT FROM MODEL VARIATIONS AND INTERNAL NOISE: ALL FORCED MODEL EXPERIMENTS AGREE IN PREDICTING A SUBSTANTIAL WARMING IN THE EASTERN TROPICAL PACIFIC. THIS OCEANIC HEATING DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO A MODIFICATION OF ENSO TOWARDS MORE FREQUENT EL NINO AND/OR LA NINA EVENTS. IT SIMPLY REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN THE BACKGROUND STATE OF ENSO. INDEED, WE DID NOT FIND CONVINCING MULTI-MODEL EVIDENCE FOR A MODIFICATION OF THE WAVELET SPECTRA IN TERMS OF ENSO OR THE MONSOONS.

IT IS FOUND THAT THE PRESENCE OF SHALLOW CONVECTION IN THE SUBTROPICS HELPS SET THE WIDTH AND INTENSITY OF OCEANIC ITCZS, A MECHANISM HERE TERMED THE SHALLOW CUMULUS HUMIDITY THROTTLE BECAUSE OF THE CONTROL EXERTED ON THE MOISTURE SUPPLY TO THE DEEP CONVECTION ZONES. THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE REACHED AFTER INVESTIGATIONS BASED ON A TROPICAL CLIMATE MODEL OF INTERMEDIATE COMPLEXITY, WITH SUFFICIENT VERTICAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM TO CAPTURE (I) THE EFFECTS OF SHALLOW CONVECTION ON THE BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE BUDGET AND (II) THE DEPENDENCY OF DEEP CONVECTION ON THE FREE-TROPOSPHERIC HUMIDITY. AN EXPLICIT SHALLOW CUMULUS MIXING TIME SCALE IN THIS SIMPLE PARAMETERIZATION IS VARIED TO ASSESS SENSITIVITY, WITH MOIST STATIC ENERGY BUDGET ANALYSIS AIDING TO IDENTIFY HOW THE LOCAL EFFECT OF SHALLOW CONVECTION IS BALANCED GLOBALLY. A REDUCTION IN THE MIXING EFFICIENCY OF SHALLOW CONVECTION LEADS TO A MORE HUMID ATMOSPHERIC MIXED LAYER, AND LESS SURFACE EVAPORATION, WITH A DRIER FREE TROPOSPHERE OUTSIDE OF THE CONVECTING ZONES. ADVECTION OF DRIER FREE-TROPOSPHERIC AIR FROM THE SUBTROPICS BY TRANSIENTS SUCH AS DRY INTRUSIONS, AS WELL AS BY MEAN INFLOW, CAUSES A SUBSTANTIAL NARROWING OF THE CONVECTION ZONES BY INHIBITION OF DEEP CONVECTION AT THEIR MARGINS. IN THE TROPICAL MEAN, THE REDUCTION OF CONVECTION BY THIS NARROWING MORE THAN COMPENSATES FOR THE REDUCTION IN SURFACE EVAPORATION. BALANCE IS ESTABLISHED VIA A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE TROPICS, ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION IN CONVECTIVE HEATING.

THE AEROSOL REFLECTION IS THE DOMINANT AEROSOL FORCING, WHILE THE AEROSOL ABSORPTION HAS COMPLEX BUT MUCH WEAKER INFLUENCES ON THE REGIONAL TROPICAL PRECIPITATION BASED ON THE ECHAM4 AEROSOL FORCING. THE LOCAL EFFECT ASSOCIATED WITH AEROSOLS CONTRIBUTES NEGATIVE PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES OVER CONVECTIVE REGIONS BY AFFECTING THE NET ENERGY FLUX INTO THE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN. THIS NET ENERGY FLUX IS CONTROLLED BY THE RADIATIVE FORCING AT THE TOP OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON TIME SCALES WHERE SURFACE HEAT FLUX IS NEAR EQUILIBRIUM, BALANCING ANOMALOUS SOLAR RADIATION BY EVAPORATION, LONGWAVE RADIATION, AND SENSIBLE HEAT. CONSIDERING THE AEROSOL ABSORPTION EFFECT ALONE, THE ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES ARE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE BUT SMALL WHEN SURFACE HEAT FLUXES ARE NEAR EQUILIBRIUM. TWO EFFECTS FOUND IN GLOBAL WARMING, THE UPPEDANTE MECHANISM AND THE ANOMALOUS GROSS MOIST STABILITY MECHANISM, OCCUR WITH OPPOSITE SIGN IN THE AEROSOL CASE. BOTH ACT AS REMOTE EFFECTS VIA THE WIDESPREAD COLD TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES INDUCED BY THE AEROSOL FORCING. IN THE UPPED-ANTE MECHANISM IN GLOBAL WARMING, A WARM TROPOSPHERE INCREASES THE LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE ``ANTE'' REQUIRED FOR CONVECTION, CREATING SPATIALLY VARYING MOISTURE ANOMALIES THAT DISFAVOR PRECIPITATION ON THOSE MARGINS OF CONVECTIVE ZONES WHERE THE MEAN FLOW IMPORTS AIR FROM NONCONVECTIVE REGIONS. IN THE AEROSOL CASE HERE, A COOL TROPOSPHERE PREFERENTIALLY DECREASES MOISTURE IN CONVECTIVE REGIONS, CREATING POSITIVE PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES AT INFLOW MARGINS. IN THE ANOMALOUS GROSS MOIST STABILITY MECHANISM FOR THE AEROSOL CASE, THE DECREASE IN MOISTURE IN CONVECTIVE REGIONS ACTS TO ENHANCE THE GROSS MOIST STABILITY, SO CONVECTION AND THE ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION ARE REDUCED. THE PARTITIONING BETWEEN THE AEROSOL LOCAL AND REMOTE EFFECTS ON REGIONAL TROPICAL PRECIPITATION DIFFERS SPATIALLY.

SPECIFICALLY, THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE MEAN THERMOCLINE IN THE EEIO IS RAISED OR LOWERED DEPENDING ON THE PHASE OF PACIFIC DECADAL VARIABILITY (PDV), PRECONDITIONING THE EEIO TO FAVOR STRONGER OR WEAKER IODZM ACTIVITY, IS EXAMINED. DIAGNOSTICS REVEAL THAT THE EEIO IS PRECONDITIONED BY THE TRADITIONAL PDV SIGNAL (SVD1 OF SST), DEEPENING OR SHOALING THE THERMOCLINE OFF SOUTH JAVA THROUGH ITS INFLUENCE ON THE INDONESIAN THROUGHFIOW (ITF; OCEANIC TELECONNECTION), AND BY RESIDUAL DECADAL VARIABILITY IN THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL PACIFIC (SVD2 OF SST) THAT CHANGES THE EQUATORIAL WINDS OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN (ATMOSPHERIC TELECONNECTION). BOTH EFFECTS PRODUCE A BACKGROUND STATE THAT IS EITHER FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE FOR THE THERMOCLINE-MIXED LAYER INTERACTIONS, AND HENCE FOR THE EXCITATION OF STRONG IODZM EVENTS. COLLECTIVELY, SVD1 AND SVD2 ARE REFERRED TO AS PDV HERE. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS TESTED WITH A SUITE OF OCEAN MODEL EXPERIMENTS. FIRST, TWO RUNS ARE CARRIED OUT, FORCED BY CLIMATOLOGICAL WINDS TO WHICH IDEALIZED EASTERLY OR WESTERLY WINDS ARE ADDED ONLY OVER THE EQUATORIAL INDIAN OCEAN. AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, IN THE EASTERLY (WESTERLY) RUN A SHALLOWER (DEEPER) THERMOCLINE IS OBTAINED OVER THE EEIO. THEN, OBSERVED WINDS FROM INDIVIDUAL YEARS ARE USED TO FORCE THE MODEL. IN THESE RUNS, ANOMALOUSLY COOL SST IN THE EEIO DEVELOPS ONLY DURING DECADES WHEN THE THERMOCLINE IS ANOMALOUSLY SHALLOW, ALLOWING ENTRAINMENT OF COLDER WATERS INTO THE MIXED LAYER. SINCE 1999 THE PDV PHASE HAS CHANGED, AND CONSISTENT WITH THIS HYPOTHESIS THE DEPTH OF THE MEAN THERMOCLINE IN THE EEIO HAS BEEN INCREASING. AS A CONSEQUENCE, NO IODZM DEVELOPED DURING THE EL NINO, OF 2002, AND ONLY A WEAK COOLING EVENT OCCURRED DURING THE SUMMER OF 2003. THIS HYPOTHESIS LIKELY ALSO EXPLAINS WHY SOME STRONG IODZM EVENTS OCCUR IN THE ABSENCE OF ENSO FORCING, PROVIDED THAT PDV HAS PRECONDITIONED THE EEIO THERMOCLINE TO BE ANOMALOUSLY SHALLOW.",""

THE RESULTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT A STRONG WARMING SIGNAL HAS EMERGED IN THE CENTRAL GREATER CAUCASUS, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE 1993/1994 MASS BALANCE YEAR, AND THIS HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SUMMER ABLATION OF DJANKUAT. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPENSATING CONSISTENT INCREASE IN WINTER PRECIPITATION AND ACCUMULATION LEADING TO THE STRONG NET LOSS OF MASS AND INCREASE IN GLACIER RUNOFF. INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY IN ABLATION AND ACCUMULATION IS PARTLY ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN MAJOR PATTERNS OF NORTHERN HEMISPHERE CLIMATIC VARIABILITY. THE POSITIVE PHASE OF THE NORTH PACIFIC (NP) TELECONNECTION PATTERN FORCES NEGATIVE GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT AND TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES OVER THE CAUCASUS IN SUMMER AND RESULTS IN REDUCED SUMMER MELT, SUCH AS IN THE EARLY 1990S, WHEN POSITIVE NP EXTREMES RESULTED IN A TEMPORARY DECLINE IN ABLATION RATES. THE POSITIVE PHASE OF THE NP IS RELATED TO EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A TELECONNECTION BETWEEN THE TROPICAL PACIFIC SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND SUMMER AIR TEMPERATURES IN THE CAUCASUS IS BRIDGED THROUGH THE NP PATTERN. MORE RECENTLY, THE NP PATTERN WAS PREDOMINANTLY NEGATIVE, AND THIS DISTANT MODERATING FORCING ON SUMMER ABLATION IN THE CAUCASUS WAS ABSENT. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS ARE OBSERVED BETWEEN ACCUMULATION AND THE SCANDINAVIAN (SCA) TELECONNECTION PATTERN.

FOR EACH MONTH, FROM OCTOBER TO APRIL, AVERAGES OF THE MONTHLY MEAN TEMPERATURES AND THE MONTHLY RAINFALL TOTALS AS WELL AS THE STANDARDIZED VALUES OF BOTH PARAMETERS WERE CALCULATED SEPARATELY FOR THE NEGATIVE (NCP AND THE POSITIVE (NCP (+)) PHASES OF THE NCP. AT ALL STATIONS AND IN ALL MONTHS, TEMPERATURE VALUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DURING THE NCP (-) AS COMPARED WITH THE NCP (+). FURTHERMORE, APART FROM VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE ABSOLUTE MONTHLY MEAN MAXIMUM AND MONTHLY MEAN MINIMUM VALUES WERE OBTAINED DURING THE NCP (-) AND THE NCP (+) PHASES, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAXIMUM IMPACT OF THE NCP ON MEAN AIR TEMPERATURE WAS DETECTED IN THE CONTINENTAL ANATOLIAN PLATEAU, WHERE THE MEAN SEASONAL DIFFERENCES ARE AROUND 3.5DEGREESC. THIS INFLUENCE DECREASES WESTWARDS AND SOUTHWARDS. THE INFLUENCE ON THE RAINFALL REGIME IS MORE COMPLEX. REGIONS EXPOSED TO THE SOUTHERN MARITIME TRAJECTORIES, IN GREECE AND IN TURKEY, RECEIVE MORE RAINFALL DURING THE NCP (-) PHASE, WHEREAS IN THE REGIONS EXPOSED TO THE NORTHERN MARITIME TRAJECTORIES, SUCH AS CRETE IN GREECE, THE BLACK SEA REGION IN TURKEY, AND IN ALL REGIONS OF ISRAEL, THERE IS MORE RAINFALL DURING THE NCP (+) PHASE. THE ACCUMULATED RAINFALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO PHASES ARE OVER 50\% OF THE SEASONAL AVERAGE FOR SOME STATIONS. A COMPARISON OF THE CAPABILITIES OF THE NCP, THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO) AND THE SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (SO) INDICES TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN BELOW AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WAS MADE.

THE FIRST KEY TOPIC OF THIS STUDY IS THE IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE ASPECTS OF ANOMALOUS PACIFIC SST VARIABILITY THAT ARE MOST STRONGLY LINKED TO THE SAHEL. ONE OF THESE, ALSO ILLUMINATED BY EARLIER STUDIES, IS SIMILAR TO THE CLASSIC EL NINO SOUTHERN OSCILLATION PATTERN IN THE CENTRAL AND EAST PACIFIC, WHICH IN ITS EL NINO PHASE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SAHEL DROUGHT. IT IS SHOWN HERE THAT, ALTHOUGH A PART OF THIS LINK IS INDIRECT (OPERATING VIA ATLANTIC SSTS), ITS MAIN EFFECT APPEARS TO BE THROUGH A DIRECT ATMOSPHERIC TELECONNECTION. THE OTHER CRITICAL PATTERN, OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE AND REVEALED HERE BY A NOVEL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE, IS THE LARGE-SCALE ZONAL GRADIENT OF SSTS FROM THE WEST PACIFIC TO THE CAST INDIAN OCEAN. IF WEAKENED, THIS TOO ENHANCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SAHEL DROUGHT. ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL CIRCULATION MODEL EXPERIMENTS, FORCED EITHER BY OBSERVED OR IDEALIZED SSTS, ARE USED TO CONFIRM THESE TWO INFLUENCES ON THE SAHEL. CRUCIALLY, THEIR SAHELIAN IMPACT IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINFORCED WHEN BOTH ARE PRESENT AND, ADDITIONALLY, FURTHER EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THEM TO BE LARGELY INDEPENDENT. THE SECOND KEY TOPIC IS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISMS FOR THIS PACIFIC-SAHEL TELECONNECTION. THESE APPEAR TO INVOLVE ANOMALOUS STATIONARY EQUATORIAL WAVES, WITH COMMUNICATION OCCURRING IN BOTH THE EASTWARD AND WESTWARD DIRECTIONS. IN EL NINO YEARS (FOR EXAMPLE), A KELVIN WAVE EMANATES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC FROM EAST PACIFIC CONVECTIVE HEATING ANOMALIES, AND AN EQUATORIAL ROSSBY WAVE APPEARS OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN IN RESPONSE TO THE ANOMALOUS WEST PACIFIC-INDIAN OCEAN SST GRADIENTS VIA CONVECTIVE HEATING ANOMALIES OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN.

THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT, UNLIKE CALIFORNIA, THE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF BOTH ANNUAL AND MONTHLY PRECIPITATION IS STRONGLY LINKED TO SOI. DURING FL NINO EVENTS, ABOVE-NORMAL PRECIPITATION OCCURS LARGELY IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH; BUT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ARE SUBNORMAL DURING LA NINA EVENTS, AND MOSTLY LIMITED TO DECEMBER AND JANUARY. GRADIENTS OF PRECIPITATION DEPARTURE TEND TO BE UNIFORM ACROSS BAJA CALIFORNIA DURING INDIVIDUAL YEARS. THE VARIABILITY OF PRECIPITATION IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE INTERANNUAL DISLOCATION BY ENSO OF THE POLAR-FRONT JET STREAM ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST, AS DESCRIBED IN OTHER STUDIES. IN FL NINO EVENTS, THE CIRCULATION ACQUIRES A POSITIVE-PHASE PACIFIC-NORTH AMERICA (PNA) PATTERN, WITH AN ENHANCED TROPICAL NORTHERN HEMISPHERE (TNH) TELECONNECTION MODE EXPRESSED IN A SOUTHERN-BRANCH JET STREAM ACROSS BAJA CALIFORNIA. THERE IS STRONG ON-SHORE ADVECTION OF MOIST SURFACE WESTERLIES ON THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. IN LA. NINA EVENTS, THE COMPOSITE CIRCULATION ACQUIRES A. NEGATIVE-PHASE PNA PATTERN, AND THE JET STREAM IS MOSTLY POLEWARD OF BAJA. CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA. THIS RESULTS IN WEAK ON-SHORE ADVECTION BY MOIST SURFACE WESTERLIES. SEASONAL SHIFTS IN PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES MAY BE RELATED TO GEOGRAPHIC SHIFTS IN DIABATIC FORCING FROM THE EQUATORIAL WARM POOL, AND CONSEQUENT TELECONNECTIONS INTO THE EXTRA-TROPICAL WAVE-TRAIN IN THE PACIFIC-NORTH AMERICAN REGION. THE ANNUAL UNIFORMITY OF PRECIPITATION DEPARTURES ACROSS THE EIGHT SUBREGIONS OF BAJA CALIFORNIA SUGGESTS THAT FRONTAL STORMS DO NOT PRODUCE ANOMALOUS OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION GRADIENTS DURING EL NINOS.

THE MAIN FINDING IS THAT THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF THE NAO, PNA, AND WP TELECONNECTIONS CAN BE INTERPRETED AS BEING A STOCHASTIC (MARKOV) PROCESS WITH AN E-FOLDING TIMESCALE BETWEEN 7.4 AND 9.5 DAYS. THE TIME SERIES CORRESPONDING TO THE ENSO SPATIAL PATTERN DID NOT MATCH THAT OF A MARKOV PROCESS, AND THUS A WELL-DEFINED TIMESCALE COULD NOT BE SPECIFIED. THE SHORTNESS OF THE ABOVE TIMESCALES INDICATES THAT THE EXCITATION OF THESE TELECONNECTION PATTERNS IS LIMITED TO A PERIOD OF TIME LESS THAN A FEW DAYS.

IN MOST REGARDS, THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION ARE REPRODUCED REASONABLY WELL BY THE GFS WHEN COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONS AND ANALYSES OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AS FOR THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES, THE MAJOR FEATURES OF OBSERVED PRECIPITATION, SUCH AS THE INTERTROPICAL CONVERGENCE ZONE (ITCZ), THE ASIAN MONSOON REGIMES, AND THE EXTRATROPICAL STORM TRACKS, ARE WELL CAPTURED IN THE GFS SIMULATION. SIMILARLY, OTHER CLIMATE FEATURES OF OBSERVED PRECIPITATION, NAMELY THE REGIONS OF LOW PRECIPITATION RATES OVER THE SUBTROPICAL SUBSIDENCE ZONES AND POLAR AREAS, ARE ALSO WELL DEFINED BY THE GFS. THE SIMULATED PRECIPITATION PATTERN, HOWEVER, EXHIBITS SOME OBVIOUS DISCREPANCIES FROM THE OBSERVED IN THE TROPICS. EXCESSIVE PRECIPITATION IS SIMULATED BY THE GFS OVER SOME TROPICAL REGIONS WHERE THERE ARE COMPLEX TOPOGRAPHIC VARIATIONS AMONG OCEANS AND LANDS. OTHERWISE, THE GFS PRECIPITATION IN THE REMAINING TROPICAL REGIONS IS GENERALLY UNDERESTIMATED. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNDERESTIMATE OF MODEL PRECIPITATION OVER THE TROPICAL EASTERN PACIFIC RESULTS IN A LOCAL ITCZ THAT IS LESS ORGANIZED IN SPATIAL STRUCTURE THAN THE OBSERVED. THIS MODEL PRECIPITATION DEFICIENCY IS LINKED TO UNDERESTIMATES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT AND WATER VAPOR CONVERGENCE OVER THE TROPICAL EASTERN PACIFIC IN THE GFS SIMULATION. REGARDING THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ZONAL MEAN STATE, THE ZONAL MEAN CLIMATOLOGIES OF TEMPERATURE AND ZONAL WIND ARE ADEQUATELY SIMULATED BY THE GFS WHEN COMPARED TO ANALYSES. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SIMULATED AND ANALYZED ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURES IS A SYSTEMATIC COLD BIAS IN THE MODEL TROPOSPHERE. THIS COLD BIAS IS GENERALLY WITHIN 4 DEGREES K OF THE ANALYSES FOR MOST OF THE TROPOSPHERIC DOMAIN BOUNDED BY 40 DEGREES S AND 40 DEGREES N. THE MODEL COLD BIAS BECOMES SIGNIFICANT AT THE POLAR TROPOPAUSE, WHERE THE SIMULATED ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURE CAN BE FROM 8 DEGREES K TO 18 DEGREES K COLDER THAN THE ANALYZED. ALSO NOTEWORTHY IS THE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ZONAL MEAN TEMPERATURE BIAS AND ZONAL MEAN ZONAL WIND BIAS. THIS IS FOUND TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE REAL TEMPERATURE AND THE REAL ZONAL WIND FIELDS KNOWN AS THE THERMAL WIND RELATIONSHIP. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE THERMAL AND DYNAMIC FIELDS IN THE GFS SIMULATION MUST BE TO A GREAT EXTENT CONSISTENT WITH ANALYSES WITH REGARD TO THE THERMAL WIND RELATIONSHIP. REGARDING THE CLIMATE CHARACTERISTICS OF ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION, THE PRIMARY CIRCULATION FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUMMER MONSOON SYSTEM AND WINTER TELECONNECTION PATTERN ARE WELL REPRESENTED IN THE GFS SIMULATION WHEN COMPARED WITH ANALYSES.

THE PRESENCE OF STRONG EAST-WEST GRADIENT OF SST ANOMALIES ACROSS THE PHILIPPINES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SIGNIFICANT COUPLING OF WEAK (STRONG) SOUTH ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON AND THE WARM (COLD) EPISODE OF ENSO.

THE REVIEW IS FOCUSED ON THE CLIMATOLOGY AND VARIABILITY OF THE EAM RAINFALL AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH REGIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALE CIRCULATION SYSTEMS. CLIMATOLOGICALLY, THE EAM RAINFALL IS DOMINATED BY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NORTHWARD ADVANCE OF THE MEI-YU TROUGH FROM SOUTHERN CHINA DURING APRIL-MAY TO CENTRAL CHINA DURING MID-JUNE. AFTER STAYING IN THE SAME POSITION FOR ONE TO TWO WEEKS, THE MEI- YU TROUGH DISAPPEARS ABRUPTLY AND A NEW RAINFALL ZONE IS DEVELOPED OVER NORTHERN CHINA. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A QUASI-20 DAYS OSCILLATORY RAINFALL REGIME WHICH DEVELOPS OVER CENTRAL CHINA. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE MAXIMUM RAINFALL ZONE RETURNS TO THE COASTAL REGION OF SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST CHINA. REGIONAL FEATURES UNIQUE TO THE EAM INCLUDE THE EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH OF THE EXTENDED MONSOON SEASON (APRIL TO LATE AUGUST), THE EXTENT OF THE NORTHWARD PENETRATION OF THE MAJOR PRECIPITATION. THE MULTIPLE ONSET AND INTERSPERSED PROPAGATION AND STATIONARY NATURE OF THE RAINFALL PLANETARY SCALE FEATURES THAT DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE EAM INCLUDE THE WESTERN PACIFIC SUBTROPICAL HIGH, THE TIBETAN HIGH, THE LOCAL HADLEY AND THE EQUATORIAL WALKER CIRCULATIONS. IT IS STRESSED THAT THE EAM RAINFALL IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF GLOBAL SCALE PRECIPITATION SYSTEM WHICH MIGRATES NORTHWARD FROM THE EQUATORIAL INDIAN OCEAN AND THE WESTERN PACIFIC TO THE EAM REGION AND INDIAN SUBCONTINENT DURING THE BOREAL SUMMER. THE EAM POSSESSES A WIDE RANGE OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES OF VARIABILITIES INCLUDING THE SEASONAL CYCLE, INTRASEASONAL OSCILLATIONS, SUBSEASONAL SCALE INTER-MONSOON INTERACTIONS, SUB-SYNOPTIC SCALE VARIABILITY AND SUPERCLUSTER ORGANIZATION IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC.

THE MAIN RESULTS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: (1) IN SPRING, THE ALBEDO EFFECT IS DOMINATED IN THE LOWER LATITUDES PARTICULARLY OVER THE TIBETAN PLATEAU. THE REDUCED NET RADIATION BY THE ANOMALOUS SNOW COVER BALANCES THE REDUCED SURFACE SENSIBLE AND LATENT HEAT FLUXES, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF SURFACE TEMPERATURE, CLOUDINESS AND TOTAL DIABATIC HEATING OVER THERE IN THE SNOW RUNS. (2) IN SUMMER, IN CONTRAST, THE SNOW-HYDROLOGICAL EFFECT IS SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-LATITUDES. THE INCREASE OF GROUND WETNESS IN THE SNOW RUNS CAUSES ANOMALOUS COOLING AND HIGHER PRESSURE NEAR THE SURFACE. A MODERATE SIGNAL OF THE WEAKENED ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON IS ALSO OBTAINED.

NATURAL REPLENISHMENT OF GROUNDWATER OCCURS PREDOMINANTLY FROM INFILTRATION OF PRECIPITATION AND SURFACE IMPOUNDMENTS. THEREFORE, THE FIRST STAGE OF THE STUDY WAS TO REVIEW A CHANGED HYDROLOGIC CYCLE UNDER RCP 8.5 IN TERMS OF INFLUENCE FROM (1) PRECIPITATION, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION, AND SOIL MOISTURE; (2) SURFACE WATER AND ITS INTERACTION WITH GROUNDWATER; (3) EXTREME HYDROLOGIC EVENTS, AND (4) TELECONNECTION PATTERNS.

BECAUSE THE METRICS OF COLDNESS ARE BASED ON MULTIPLE LAYERS IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THEY PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSMENT OF WARMING THAN IS PROVIDED BY SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURES ALONE. THE NEGATIVE TRENDS OF PCAM AND NHC ARE STRONGER (AS A \% PER DECADE) WHEN THE THRESHOLD IS 245 KRATHER THAN 280 K, INDICATING THAT THE LOSS OF EXTREMELY COLD AIR IS HAPPENING AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE LOSS OF MODERATELY COLD AIR.

SYSTEMATIC ISOTOPIC SHIFTS ASSOCIATED WITH MYR-SCALE SEA-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS, HOWEVER, INDICATE AN EXTRABASINAL DRIVER. WE PROPOSE A MECHANISTIC LINK TO GLACIOEUSTASY THROUGH A TELECONNECTION BETWEEN HIGH-LATITUDE ICE CHANGES AND ATMOSPHERIC PCO(2) AND REGIONAL MONSOONAL CIRCULATION IN THE DONETS REGION. INFERRED LARGE-MAGNITUDE CHANGES IN DONETS SEAWATER SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE, NOT ARCHIVED IN THE MORE OPEN-WATER OR GLOBAL CONTEMPORANEOUS RECORDS, INDICATE A MODIFICATION OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SIGNAL IN THE EPICONTINENTAL SEA THROUGH AMPLIFICATION OR DAMPENING OF THE CLIMATE SIGNAL BY LOCAL AND REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES.

THE PDV IS NOW RECOGNIZED TO CONSIST OF MULTIPLE OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE MODES AND TO BE CAUSED BY MULTIPLE PROCESSES. AT THE LEADING ORDER, PDV CAN BE VIEWED AS THE REDDENING PROCESS OF STOCHASTIC ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY ON THE EXTRATROPICAL OCEAN. HOWEVER, PDV IS ALSO STRONGLY TIED TO TELECONNECTION DYNAMICS INTERACTING WITH THE TROPICS, PRIMARILY THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MERIDIONAL MODES IN THE EXTRA-TROPICS AND ENSO, AND BETWEEN THE ENSO TELECONNECTIONS AND THE DOMINANT MODES OF ATMOSPHERIC VARIABILITY IN THE MID-LATITUDE. RECENT FINDINGS EXTRATROPICAL OCEANIC ROSSBY WAVES ARE FOUND TO BE CRUCIAL FOR DETERMINING THE DECADAL TIME SCALES OF THE PDV AND PROVIDE POTENTIALLY AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF PREDICTABILITY OF PDV. PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS WITH GCMS AND EMPIRICAL LINEAR INVERSE MODELS HAVE SHOWN SOME SKILL FOR THE PREDICTION OF PDV IN OCEAN SURFACE TEMPERATURES. WHILE THE CLIMATE PREDICTIONS IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE OCEANIC INITIAL CONDITION, PREDICTIONS OF NEAR DECADAL TIME SCALES ARE CONTRIBUTED MOSTLY BY THE GLOBAL WARMING TREND. IN ADDITION, RECENT STUDIES EXPLORED THE ROLE OF OCEAN SUBSURFACE DYNAMICS FOR MULTI-DECADAL PREDICTABILITY IN THE PACIFIC AND SUGGEST THAT SUBSURFACE DYNAMICS MAY LEAD TO IMPORTANT SOURCES OF DECADAL PREDICTABILITY IN REGIONAL UPWELLING SYSTEMS, NAMELY THE EASTERN BOUNDARY AND POLAR GYRE. OVERALL, THE PREDICTABILITY OF PDV AND THE RELATED SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE SIGNALS REMAIN TO BE MUCH STUDIED. SUMMARY RECENT STUDIES ALSO START TO EXPLORE THE RELATION BETWEEN PDV AND GLOBAL WARMING. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT PDV CAN SLOW DOWN OR ACCELERATE THE GLOBAL WARMING TREND SIGNIFICANTLY. THE INFLUENCE OF THE ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE ON PDV, HOWEVER, HAS REMAINED UNCLEAR.",""

AS FOR THE TEMPORAL FEATURES, VARIABILITIES OF PNA AND NPO IN MOST MODELS ARE BIASED TOWARD HIGHER AMPLITUDE. ADDITIONALLY, MOST MODELS SIMULATE THE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITIES OF PNA AND NPO, QUALITATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH THE OBSERVATION, WHEREAS MODELS GENERALLY LACK THE CAPABILITY TO REPRODUCE THE DECADAL (20-25 YEARS) VARIABILITY OF PNA.

THE INTENSIFICATION OF POSITIVE PNA IS PRIMARILY MANIFESTED IN THE LARGE DEEPENING OF THE NORTH PACIFIC TROUGH, WHICH IS ROBUST AS IT IS 2.3 TIMES THE UNFORCED INTERNAL VARIABILITY. BY FOCUSING ON THE TROPICAL PACIFIC OCEAN, WE FIND THAT THE MULTIDECADAL EVOLUTION OF THE NORTH PACIFIC TROUGH INTENSITY (DOMINATING THE PNA INTENSITY EVOLUTION) IS CLOSELY RELATED TO THAT OF THE ANALOGOUS TROUGH IN THE PNA-LIKE TELECONNECTION FORCED BY SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES (SSTA) IN THE TROPICAL CENTRAL PACIFIC (CP) RATHER THAN THE TROPICAL EASTERN PACIFIC (EP). SUCH ASSOCIATION IS ALSO FOUND TO ACT UNDER GREENHOUSE WARMING: THAT IS, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE PNA-LIKE TELECONNECTION INDUCED BY THE CP SSTA RATHER THAN THE EP SSTA IS A DRIVING FORCE FOR THE INTENSIFICATION OF PNA. THIS IS IN PART OWING TO THE ROBUST ENHANCEMENT OF THE TROPICAL PRECIPITATION RESPONSE TO THE CP SST VARIATION.

THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE IMPACT OF THE RECENT SEA ICE DECLINE IS RATHER LIMITED TO THE HIGH-LATITUDE LOWER TROPOSPHERE IN WINTER, AND THE SEA ICE CHANGES DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LEAD TO COLDER WINTERS OVER SIBERIA. THE OBSERVED WINTERTIME SIBERIAN TEMPERATURE AND CORRESPONDING CIRCULATION TRENDS ARE REPRODUCED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF ENSEMBLE MEMBERS BUT NOT BY THE MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE MEAN, SUGGESTING THAT ATMOSPHERIC INTERNAL DYNAMICS COULD HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN THE OBSERVED TRENDS. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISM GOVERNING THE ONGOING GLOBAL WARMING IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FACING OUR SOCIETY AND ITS SUSTAINABLE GROWTH. TOGETHER WITH THE CO2-FORCED WARMING, THE CONCURRENT POLAR SEA ICE LOSS MIGHT ALSO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED ARCTIC WARMING AMPLIFICATION AND ALSO TO THE COOLING TRENDS OVER EURASIA THROUGH A DYNAMICAL TELECONNECTION. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS INDIVIDUAL MODELING STUDIES SUGGEST WIDELY DIFFERENT FINDINGS ON THE ROLE OF SEA ICE LOSS IN NORTHERN HEMISPHERE CLIMATE CHANGE. TO HELP RESOLVE THIS CONTROVERSY, WE USED SATELLITE-DERIVED SEA ICE AND SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE TO RUN COORDINATED HINDCAST EXPERIMENTS WITH FIVE DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERIC GENERAL CIRCULATION MODELS. THE MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE-MEAN RESULTS PRESENTED IN THE PAPER REDUCE BIASES OF EACH MODEL AND ELIMINATE ATMOSPHERIC INTERNAL UNFORCED VARIABILITY, AND THUS PROVIDE THE BEST ESTIMATE TO DATE OF THE SIGNAL OF THE POLAR SEA ICE LOSS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE IMPACT OF SEA ICE SEEMS CRITICAL FOR THE ARCTIC SURFACE TEMPERATURE CHANGES, BUT THE TEMPERATURE TRENDS ELSEWHERE SEEM RATHER DUE TO EITHER SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE CHANGES OR ATMOSPHERIC INTERNAL VARIABILITY.

THIS HYPOTHESIS IS WELL SUPPORTED BY THE PROCESS-BASED LINKAGE BETWEEN HADLEY CIRCULATION AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATIONS OVER THE ASIAN-PACIFIC REGION ON THE INTERDECADAL TIME SCALE. THE STRENGTHENING OF WINTER HADLEY CIRCULATION CORRESPONDS TO A WEAKENING OF THE SIBERIAN HIGH, AN EASTWARD SHIFTING OF THE ALEUTIAN LOW, A REDUCTION OF THE EAST ASIAN TROUGH, AND ANOMALOUS SOUTHWESTERLY PREVAILING OVER NORTHEASTERN CHINA.

ON AVERAGE, THIS COAST EXPERIENCES 30 STORMS/YEAR OCCURRING PREDOMINANTLY IN WINTER, THREE OF THEM CONSIDERED SEVERE (CATEGORIES III-IV). THE EXTREME STORMS (CAT.

WE SHOW THAT THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE UN HAS GRADUALLY SHIFTED FROM FAVORING CIVIL SOCIETY TO CORPORATIONS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT, IN THE LATE 1990S, IN COMPARISON WITH CSOS, TNCS INCREASED THEIR ACCESS TO NATION-STATES AND UN AGENCIES. THE TNC NARRATIVE CHANGED FROM A) DENYING CLIMATE CHANGE AND IGNORING THE UN TO B) RECOGNIZING CHANGE AND GUIDING NEGOTIATIONS. THESE SHIFTS IN UN ARCHITECTURE, TNC AGENCY AND NARRATIVE APPEARS TO HAVE INFLUENCED CHANGES IN UN DOCUMENTS TOWARDS A CORPORATE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FRAMEWORK, REDUCING THEIR REFERENCES TO THE REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT ROLES OF THE STATE AND GLOBAL BINDING AGREEMENTS, SHIFTING GLOBAL DEBATE TOWARDS A VOLUNTARY CORPORATE ORIENTATION. THIS MAY HAVE REDUCED PROSPECTS FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS AND INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. COMBINING MARKET MECHANISMS WITH STRONG REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS IS BEST PRACTICE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY. WHEN NATION-STATES HAVE THE WILL AND CAPACITY TO COMMAND AND CONTROL, THEY CAN REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. STRONGER NATIONAL GOVERNMENT COMPETENCE AND ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY AND BINDING UN AGREEMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKET INCENTIVES, WHICH MAY BE ENHANCED BY BUSINESS AND CIVIL SOCIETY INITIATIVES. IF CSOS CAN REUNITE AND REGAIN THEIR STRENGTH, MAYBE THEY COULD NEGOTIATE WITH TNCS ON A MORE EQUAL FOOTING. PERHAPS UN MEMBERS COULD ONCE AGAIN BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF STRONG STATES AND NON-HEGEMONIC GLOBAL GOVERNANCE.",""

A STRONGER TROUGH IS ASSOCIATED WITH WARMER SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND HIGHER PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL-NORTHERN NORTH AMERICA AND THE EXTRATROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC AND WITH COLDER SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND LOWER PRESSURE OVER THE ARCTIC, THE SUBTROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC, AND THE NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC. IN THE MEANTIME, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES OCCUR OVER THE NORTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA AND THE BLACK SEA, AS WELL AS THE NORTHEASTERN ATLANTIC BECAUSE OF THE ANOMALOUS LOW-LEVEL NORTHEASTERLY WINDS OVER THESE AREAS.

BECAUSE THE CLIMATE SIGNALS HAVE TO OVERCOME THE RESISTANCE OF HETEROGENEOUS AQUIFERS BEFORE REACHING SPRING DISCHARGE, WITH HIGH ENERGY, THE STRONG CLIMATE SIGNALS (E.G.

INTERACTIONS AMONG ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY STUDIED UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF ENERGY TRADE. ALTHOUGH SUCH STUDIES HAVE GENERATED IMPORTANT INSIGHTS, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS. MANY DISTANT INTERACTIONS (E.G. THOSE DUE TO THE FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR CRISIS) ARE NOT IN THE FORM OF TRADE, BUT AFFECT ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY. EVEN WHEN DISTANT INTERACTIONS ARE RELATED TO ENERGY TRADE, THEY ARE NOT SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZED. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF TRADE ARE OFTEN NOT INTEGRATED WITH ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF TRADE. IN THIS PAPER, TO IDENTIFY AND FILL IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS, WE APPLY AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK OF TELECOUPLING (SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS OVER DISTANCES). THE FRAMEWORK OF TELECOUPLING, WHICH IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND CROSS-DISCIPLINARY THAN THE ENERGY TRADE FRAMEWORK, IS A USEFUL THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL TOOL FOR ANALYZING DISTANT INTERACTIONS AMONG COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEMS (INCLUDING ENERGY SYSTEMS). TELECOUPLINGS WIDELY EXIST IN ENERGY SYSTEMS WITH VARIOUS FORMS AND LINK ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CLOSELY, SO WE PROPOSED SOME METHODS FOR ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS UNDER THE FRAMEWORK OF TELECOUPLING. FROM THE ASPECT OF CAUSES, A METHOD IS PROPOSED TO JUDGE WHETHER THE TELECOUPLING DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC FACTORS IS CONDUCIVE TO ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY. FROM THE ASPECT OF EFFECTS, A METHOD IS PROPOSED TO ASSESS WHETHER AN EVENT IS CONDUCIVE TO ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY.

WATER ISOTOPE VALUES FROM CLELAND AND PARADISE PLOT ALONG THE LOCAL EVAPORATION LINE, INDICATING THAT PRECIPITATION-EVAPORATION BALANCE IS A STRONG INFLUENCE ON LAKE HYDROLOGY. IN CONTRAST, LIME LAKE WATER ISOTOPE VALUES PLOT ON THE LOCAL METEORIC WATER LINE, SIGNIFYING MINIMAL INFLUENCE BY EVAPORATION. TO INFER PAST HYDROLOGIC BALANCE VARIATIONS AT A HIGH TEMPORAL RESOLUTION, WE SAMPLED THE CLELAND, PARADISE, AND LIME LAKE SEDIMENT CORES AT 1-60 MM INTERVALS (INVERTED IOTA 3-33 YEARS PER SAMPLE ON AVERAGE) AND MEASURED THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION OF FINE-GRAINED (<63 MU M) AUTHIGENIC CACO3 IN EACH SAMPLE. NEGATIVE 8180 VALUES, WHICH INDICATE WETTER CONDITIONS IN CLOSED-BASIN LAKES, OCCUR IN CLELAND LAKE SEDIMENT FROM 7600 TO 2200 YEARS BEFORE PRESENT (YR BP), AND ARE FOLLOWED BY MORE POSITIVE DELTA O-18 VALUES, WHICH SUGGEST DRIER CONDITIONS, AFTER 2200 YR BP. HIGHLY NEGATIVE DELTA O-18 VALUES IN THE CLELAND LAKE RECORD CENTERED ON SIMILAR TO 2400 YR BP SUGGEST THAT LAKE LEVELS WERE HIGH (AND THAT THE LAKE MAY HAVE BEEN OVERFLOWING) AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT OF A SUBSTANTIALLY WETTER CLIMATE.

RESULTS FROM MID-HOLOCENE (6000 YR BP) CLIMATE MODEL SIMULATIONS CONDUCTED AS PART OF THE PALEOCLIMATE MODELING INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT PHASE 3 (PMIP3) INDICATE THAT IN MUCH OF WESTERN NORTH AMERICA, THE COLD SEASON (OCTOBER MARCH) WAS WETTER AND THE WARM SEASON (APRIL SEPTEMBER) WAS CONSIDERABLY DRIER RELATIVE TO THE LATE HOLOCENE, LEADING TO AN OVERALL DRIER CLIMATE IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA WITH ENHANCED HYDROCLIMATIC SEASONALITY.

THE TPSC VARIABILITY EXPLAINS MORE THAN 30 \% OF THE TOTAL VARIANCES OF HEAT WAVE VARIABILITY IN THE SOUTHERN EUROPE AND NORTHEASTERN ASIA (SENA) REGION. A SET OF NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS REVEAL THAT THE REDUCED TPSC MAY INDUCE A DISTINCT TELECONNECTION PATTERN ACROSS THE EURASIAN CONTINENT, WITH TWO ANOMALOUS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERS IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE OVER THE SENA REGION, WHICH MAY LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF THE CLOUD FORMATION NEAR THE SURFACE. THE LESS CLOUD COVER TENDS TO INCREASE THE NET SHORTWAVE RADIATION AND FAVOR A STRONGER SURFACE SENSIBLE HEAT FLUX IN THE DRY SURFACE CONDITION OVER THE SENA REGION, RESULTING IN A DEEPER, WARMER AND DRIER ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY LAYER THAT WOULD FURTHER INHIBIT THE LOCAL CLOUD FORMATION. SUCH A POSITIVE LAND-ATMOSPHERE FEEDBACK MAY DRY THE SURFACE EVEN FURTHER, HEAT THE NEAR-SURFACE ATMOSPHERE AND THEREBY INTENSIFY THE LOCAL HEAT WAVES.

IN THE WRF SIMULATIONS, THE NASH WESTERN RIDGE SHIFTS 7 DEGREES NORTHWESTWARD WHEN COMPARED TO THAT IN THE REANALYSIS ENSEMBLE, LEADING TO A DRY BIAS IN THE SIMULATED SUMMER PRECIPITATION ACCORDING TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NASH WESTERN RIDGE AND SUMMER PRECIPITATION OVER THE SOUTHEAST. EXPERIMENTS UTILIZING THE FOUR DIMENSIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION TECHNIQUE FURTHER SUGGEST THAT THE IMPROVED REPRESENTATION OF THE CIRCULATION PATTERNS (I.E., WIND FIELDS) ASSOCIATED WITH THE NASH WESTERN RIDGE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THE BIAS IN THE SIMULATED SE US SUMMER PRECIPITATION. OUR ANALYSIS OF CIRCULATION DYNAMICS INDICATES THAT THE NASH WESTERN RIDGE IN THE WRF SIMULATIONS IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE SIMULATED PLANETARY BOUNDARY LAYER (PBL) PROCESSES OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. SPECIFICALLY, A DECREASE (INCREASE) IN THE SIMULATED PBL HEIGHT TENDS TO STABILIZE (DESTABILIZE) THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO, AND THUS INHIBITS (FAVORS) THE ONSET AND/OR DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION.

THIS WORK AIMS TO CLARIFY WHERE EACH CONTRIBUTION HAS THE LARGEST EFFECT ON NORTH ATLANTIC SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) PREDICTIONS IN RELATION TO THE ATLANTIC MULTI-DECADAL VARIABILITY (AMV). INITIALIZED DECADAL HINDCASTS AND RADIATIVELY-FORCED HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS FROM THE FIFTH PHASE OF THE CLIMATE MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT ARE ANALYSED TO ASSESS MULTI-YEAR SKILL OF THE AMV. THE INITIALIZED HINDCASTS REPRODUCE BETTER THE PHASE OF THE AMV INDEX FLUCTUATIONS. THE RADIATIVELY-FORCED COMPONENT CONSISTS OF A RESIDUAL POSITIVE TREND, ALTHOUGH ITS IDENTIFICATION IS AMBIGUOUS. INITIALIZATION REDUCES THE INTER-MODEL SPREAD WHEN ESTIMATING THE LEVEL OF AMV SKILL, THUS REDUCING ITS UNCERTAINTY. OUR RESULTS SHOW A SKILFUL PERFORMANCE OF THE INITIALIZED HINDCASTS IN CAPTURING THE AMV-RELATED SST ANOMALIES OVER THE SUBPOLAR GYRE AND LABRADOR SEA REGIONS, AS WELL AS IN THE EASTERN SUBTROPICAL BASIN, AND THE INABILITY OF THE RADIATIVELY-FORCED HISTORICAL RUNS TO SIMULATE THE HORSESHOE-LIKE AMV SIGNATURE OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC. INITIALIZATION OUTPERFORMS EMPIRICAL PREDICTIONS BASED ON PERSISTENCE BEYOND 1-4 YEARS AHEAD, SUGGESTING THAT OCEAN DYNAMICS PLAY A ROLE IN THE AMV PREDICTABILITY BEYOND THE THERMAL INERTIA. THE INITIALIZED HINDCASTS ARE ALSO MORE SKILFUL AT REPRODUCING THE OBSERVED AMV TELECONNECTION TO THE WEST AFRICAN MONSOON.

THE MECHANISM FIRST PROVIDES AN INTERPRETATION OF THE CANONICAL IMPACT OF THE EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION ON THE NAO IN LATE WINTER. THE WINTERTIME RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PACIFIC-NORTH AMERICAN OSCILLATION (PNA) AND THE NAO IS ALSO INVESTIGATED. FOR OUT-OF-PHASE FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE PNA AND NAO INDICES (I.E., THE MOST RECURRENT SITUATION IN LATE WINTER), THE EASTERN PACIFIC PNA RIDGE (TROUGH) ANOMALY MODIFIES THE DIRECTION OF DOWNSTREAM WAVE PROPAGATION, TRIGGERING MORE ANTICYCLONIC (CYCLONIC) WAVE BREAKINGS OVER THE NORTH ATLANTIC.

IN SUCH CASES, IT IS NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF ECONOMIC SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT RATIONAL DISTRIBUTION POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED.

RESULTS SHOW THAT DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE, THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF SCARCE RESOURCES, COMMODITIES OR CAPITAL WILL SATISFY THE FINAL DEMANDS OF SOME ECONOMIC SECTORS AND REDUCE THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OTHERS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE REDUCTION OF TOTAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT.

THE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF THE DROUGHT REGIMES ARE IDENTIFIED USING THE ROTATED PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) ON THE SPEI, WHILE THE TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DROUGHT REGIMES ARE STUDIED USING WAVELET ANALYSIS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EACH DROUGHT REGIME AND GLOBAL SSTS (AND CLIMATE INDICES) IS QUANTIFIED USING CORRELATION ANALYSIS AND WAVELET COHERENCE ANALYSIS. THE STUDY ALSO QUANTIFIES THE CAPABILITY OF THE GCMS IN SIMULATING THE DROUGHT REGIMES. THE PCA RESULTS SHOW FOUR MAIN DROUGHT REGIMES THAT JOINTLY EXPLAIN ABOUT 50 \% SPEI VARIANCE OVER SOUTH AFRICA. THE DROUGHT REGIMES (HEREAFTER PF1, PF2, PF3 AND PF4) CENTRE OVER THE SOUTH-WESTERN PART OF SOUTHERN AFRICA (I.E.

THE LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF THE ATLANTIC MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION (AMOC) ARE SHOWN TO BE THE MAIN PRECURSOR FOR THE MODEL AMV. THE FULL LIFE CYCLE OF AMOC/AMV EVENTS RELIES ON A COMPLEX TIME-EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO) AND EAST ATLANTIC PATTERN (EAP) THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED FROM A SEASONAL PERSPECTIVE IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THEIR ACTION; THE OCEAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE MULTIDECADAL TIMESCALE OF THE FLUCTUATIONS. AMOC RISE LEADING TO A WARM PHASE OF AMV IS STATISTICALLY PRECEDED BY WINTERTIME NAO+ AND EAP+ FROM SIMILAR TO LAG -40/-20 YRS. ASSOCIATED WIND STRESS ANOMALIES INDUCE AN ACCELERATION OF THE SUBPOLAR GYRE (SPG) AND ENHANCED NORTHWARD TRANSPORT OF WARM AND SALINE SUBTROPICAL WATER. CONCURRENT POSITIVE SALINITY ANOMALIES OCCUR IN THE GREENLAND-ICELAND-NORWEGIAN SEAS IN LINK TO LOCAL SEA-ICE DECLINE; THOSE ARE ADVECTED BY THE EASTERN GREENLAND CURRENT TO THE LABRADOR SEA PARTICIPATING TO THE PROGRESSIVE DENSIFICATION OF THE SPG AND THE INTENSIFICATION OF OCEAN DEEP CONVECTION LEADING TO AMOC STRENGTHENING.

(1) THE EAWM HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE. WINTER TEMPERATURE IN CHINA HAS EXPERIENCED THREE STAGES OF VARIATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 1950S: A COLD PERIOD (FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE 1950S TO THE EARLY OR MID 1980S), A WARM PERIOD (FROM THE EARLY OR MID 1980S TO THE EARLY 2000S), AND A HIATUS PERIOD IN RECENT 10 YEARS (STARTING FROM 1998). THE STRENGTH OF THE EAWM HAS ALSO VARIED IN THREE STAGES: A STRONGER WINTER MONSOON PERIOD (1950 TO 1986/87), A WEAKER PERIOD (1986/87 TO 2004/05), AND A STRENGTHENING PERIOD (FROM 2005). (2) CORRESPONDING TO THE INTERDECADAL VARIATIONS OF THE EAWM, THE EAST ASIAN ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION, WINTER TEMPERATURE OF CHINA, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF COLD WAVES OVER CHINA HAVE ALL EXHIBITED COHERENT INTERDECADAL VARIABILITY. THE UPPER-LEVEL ZONAL CIRCULATION WAS STRONGER, THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OVER EAST ASIA WAS DEEPER WITH STRONGER DOWNDRAFTS BEHIND THE TROUGH, AND THE SIBERIAN HIGH WAS STRONGER DURING THE COLD PERIOD THAN DURING THE WARM PERIOD. (3) THE INTERDECADAL VARIATIONS OF THE EAWM SEEM CLOSELY RELATED TO MAJOR MODES OF VARIABILITY IN THE ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AND THE PACIFIC SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE. WHEN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE ANNULAR MODE/ARCTIC OSCILLATION AND THE PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION WERE IN NEGATIVE (POSITIVE) PHASE, THE EAWM WAS STRONGER (WEAKER), LEADING TO COLDER (WARMER) TEMPERATURES IN CHINA. IN ADDITION, THE NEGATIVE (POSITIVE) PHASE OF THE ATLANTIC MULTI DECADAL OSCILLATION COINCIDED WITH RELATIVELY COLD (WARM) TEMPERATURES AND STRONGER (WEAKER) EAWMS. IT IS THUS INFERRED THAT THE INTERDECADAL VARIATIONS IN THE OCEAN MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT NATURAL FACTORS INFLUENCING LONG-TERM VARIABILITY IN THE EAWM.

THIS STUDY INTRODUCES A NEW HYDRO-CLIMATIC FORECASTING METHOD IDENTIFYING SST ``DIPOLE'' PREDICTORS MOTIVATED BY MAJOR TELECONNECTION PATTERNS. AN SST DIPOLE IS DEFINED AS A FUNCTION OF AVERAGE SST ANOMALIES OVER TWO OCEANIC AREAS OF SPECIFIC SIZES AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS. AN OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM IS DEVELOPED TO SEARCH FOR THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SST DIPOLE PREDICTORS OF AN EXTERNAL HYDRO-CLIMATIC SERIES BASED ON THE GERRITY SKILL SCORE. THE SIGNIFICANT DIPOLES ARE CROSS-VALIDATED AND USED TO GENERATE MULTIPLE FORECAST VALUES. THE NEW METHOD IS APPLIED TO THE FORECASTING OF SEASONAL PRECIPITATION OVER THE SOUTHEAST US. HINDCASTING RESULTS SHOW THAT SIGNIFICANT DIPOLES RELATED TO ENSO AS WELL AS OTHER PROMINENT PATTERNS AT DIFFERENT LEAD TIMES CAN INDEED BE IDENTIFIED. THE DIPOLE METHOD ALSO COMPARES FAVORABLY WITH EXISTING STATISTICAL FORECASTING SCHEMES WITH RESPECT TO MULTIPLE SKILL MEASURES.

FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE SPATIAL DIFFERENCE OF PRECIPITATION AND THE RELATIONS WITH CLIMATE MODES IN TIANSHAN MTS, THIS PROJECT SELECTED INDIAN SUMMER MONSOON (ISM), EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO), AND PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION (PDO), WHICH REPRESENT ANNUAL, INTERANNUAL, AND MULTIDECADAL CLIMATE MODES, RESPECTIVELY, TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE CLIMATE MODES AND PRECIPITATION ON THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SLOPES OF TIANSHAN MTS. THE LINKAGES OF THE CLIMATE MODES TO PRECIPITATION OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SLOPES WERE INVESTIGATED BY ENSEMBLE EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION (EEMD) AND WAVELET COHERENCE ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THESE THREE CLIMATE MODES ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PRECIPITATION OVER ENTIRE TIANSHAN MTS. AT ANNUAL SCALE, ISM STRONGLY AND ALMOST EQUALLY AFFECTS PRECIPITATION ON THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SLOPES. AT INTERANNUAL SCALES, ENSO MAINLY AFFECTS THE PRECIPITATION OF THE NORTHERN SLOPE, WHICH IS THE MAJOR FACTOR CAUSING PRECIPITATION LARGER ON THE NORTH THAN THAT ON THE SOUTH.

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NON-STATIONARY MODEL DESCRIBES THE VARIABILITY OF STREAMFLOW BETTER THAN A STATIONARY ONE, AND THE COVARIATES SELECTED WITH AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AIC) PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO NONSTATIONARY BEHAVIORS. SINCE THE NSSI EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNTS FOR THE NON-STATIONARITIES OF STREAMFLOW ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGES AND HUMAN ACTIVITIES, IT PROVIDES MORE REASONABLE AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS THAN THE SSI. ADDITIONALLY, IT IS INDICATED THAT SERIOUS LONG-TERM DROUGHTS GENERALLY APPEARED MORE FREQUENTLY IN THE SOUTHEAST OF LUANHE RIVER BASIN, AND AN OBVIOUS AGGRAVATING TENDENCY OF DROUGHT WAS OBSERVED IN THIS AREA DURING 1971-2011. THE PRESENTED NSSI ENABLES HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHTS TO BE BETTER CHARACTERIZED IN A NON-STATIONARY CONTEXT, THUS PROVIDING VALUABLE REFERENCES FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF DROUGHT INDEX AND THE DROUGHT RELATED POLICY-MAKING.

HERE, OBSERVATIONAL AND MODEL EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE CHANGES IN SUMMER SEA ICE SINCE THE 2000S REFLECT A CONTINUOUS ANTHROPOGENICALLY FORCED MELTING MASKED BY INTERDECADAL VARIABILITY OF ARCTIC ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION. THIS VARIATION IS PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY TELECONNECTIONS ORIGINATING FROM SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE (SST) CHANGES IN THE EAST-CENTRAL TROPICAL PACIFIC VIA A ROSSBY WAVE TRAIN PROPAGATING INTO THE ARCTIC [HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE PACIFIC-ARCTIC TELECONNECTION (PARC)], WHICH REPRESENTS THE LEADING INTERNAL MODE CONNECTING THE POLE TO LOWER LATITUDES. THIS MODE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO ACCELERATED WARMING AND ARCTIC SEA ICE LOSS FROM 2007 TO 2012, FOLLOWED BY SLOWER DECLINES IN RECENT YEARS, RESULTING IN THE APPEARANCE OF A SLOWDOWN OVER THE PAST 11 YEARS. A PACEMAKER MODEL SIMULATION, IN WHICH WE SPECIFY OBSERVED SST IN THE TROPICAL EASTERN PACIFIC, DEMONSTRATES A PHYSICALLY PLAUSIBLE MECHANISM FOR THE PARC MODE. HOWEVER, THE MODEL-BASED PARC MECHANISM IS CONSIDERABLY WEAKER AND ONLY PARTIALLY ACCOUNTS FOR THE OBSERVED ACCELERATION OF SEA ICE LOSS FROM 2007 TO 2012. WE ALSO EXPLORE FEATURES OF LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH EXTREME MELTING PERIODS IN A LONG (1800 YR) CESM PREINDUSTRIAL SIMULATION. THESE RESULTS FURTHER SUPPORT THAT REMOTE SST FORCING ORIGINATING FROM THE TROPICAL PACIFIC CAN EXCITE SIGNIFICANT WARM EPISODES IN THE ARCTIC.

THE COMBINED INFLUENCE OF THE SUN AND VOLCANOS ON ISM IS EXAMINED USING OBSERVATIONAL DATA AS WELL AS CMIP5 MODEL OUTPUTS. POSSIBLE MECHANISMS RELATING TO A DISRUPTION OF THE USUAL ENSO-ISM TELECONNECTION FOR THOSE DECADES ARE EXPLORED. OBSERVATION SUGGESTED THAT THE REGIONAL HADLEY CIRCULATION, VIA THE NAO IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, MAY HAVE A ROLE IN THE CHANGE IN ISM BEHAVIOUR. SUCH FEATURES THOUGH CAPTURED WELL IN THE OBSERVATION ARE SHOWN MISSING IN MODELS. ADDITIONALLY, IT INDICATES THAT DIFFERENCES AMONG MODELS MAINLY ORIGINATE IN A REGIONAL LEVEL, WHICH COULD BE DUE TO INCONSISTENCY IN REPRESENTING REGIONAL TELECONNECTION FEATURES. INTERESTINGLY, ALL MODELS PERFORM REASONABLY WELL IN TERMS OF GLOBAL THERMODYNAMIC SCALING ARGUMENTS. THE OVERALL STUDY UNDERPINS IMPORTANT AREAS, WHERE NATURAL FACTORS INFLUENCE REGIONAL CLIMATE, BUT MODELS MISS OUT AND SUGGEST DISCREPANCIES AMONG EACH OTHER. SUCH KNOWLEDGE HAS MAJOR IMPLICATIONS IN REGIONAL AS WELL AS GLOBAL SCALE. THE MODELLING COMMUNITY WILL ALSO GREATLY BENEFIT BY AN IMPROVED REPRESENTATION OF ENSO AND ISM IN MODELS.",""

ACCORDING TO THE RESULT FROM AN EMPIRICAL ORTHOGONAL FUNCTION (EOF) ANALYSIS ON THE SPRING SSTAS IN THE SCSAR, THE DOMINANT PATTERN IS A UNIFORMLY WARMING PATTERN IN THE WHOLE SCSAR REGION. WHILE THE SECOND MODE IS A SANDWICH PATTERN WITH COLD SSTA OVER THE CENTRAL SCSAR CENTERED NEAR 10 DEGREES N, FLANKED BY WARM SSTA OVER THE NORTHERN OCEANS NEAR 25 DEGREES N AND IN THE SUBTROPICS NEAR 10 DEGREES S. THE UNIFORMLY WARMING PATTERN IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANOMALOUS WARMING IN THE INDIAN OCEAN FROM THE PRECEDING AUTUMN TO THE SPRING, AND THE SANDWICH PATTERN IS MAINLY CAUSED BY THE EL NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION. IN THE UNIFORMLY WARMING PATTERN, RAINFALL INCREASES IN THE MEIYU REGION AND DECREASES OVER THE SOUTHERN SOUTH CHINA SEA (SCS). IN THE SANDWICH PATTERN, THE ANOMALOUS ANTICYCLONE AT 850-HPA CAUSES LESS RAINFALL IN THE PHILIPPINE SEA, THE MARINE CONTINENT, AND THE SCS. THE POSITIVE RAINFALL ANOMALIES COULD BE FOUND IN THE NORTHERN SCS AND ADJACENT REGIONS. ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND EOF MODE, THERE IS A WAVE TRAIN EMITTED FROM THE SCSAR TO EAST ASIA, NORTHWEST PACIFIC, AND NORTH AMERICA. THE WAVE TRAIN SPREADS THE ENERGY FROM MID-LATITUDES TO HIGHER LATITUDES THROUGH ATMOSPHERIC TELECONNECTION, WHICH CAN EVEN INFLUENCE THE NORTH AMERICAN ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION IN SPRING.",""

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE MAJOR OCEANS INFLUENCE THE SEASONAL PRECIPITATION OF INDIVIDUAL SMALL ISLAND STATES WITHIN THE REGION AS CLIMATE VARIABILITY AT THE ISLAND-SCALE MAY DIFFER FROM THE CARIBBEAN AS A WHOLE. CORRELATION AND COMPOSITE ANALYSES WERE DETERMINED USING MONTHLY RAINFALL DATA FOR THE SOUTHERNMOST ISLAND OF THE CARIBBEAN, TRINIDAD, AND AN EXTENDED AREA OF GLOBAL SSTAS. IN ADDITION TO THE SUBREGIONS THAT ARE KNOWN TO MODULATE CARIBBEAN RAINFALL, OUR ANALYSES SHOW THAT SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES (SSTS) LOCATED IN THE SUBTROPICAL SOUTH PACIFIC, THE SOUTH ATLANTIC, AND THE GULF OF MEXICO ALSO HAVE WEAK (R(2) < 0.5) YET SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES ON THE ISLANDS' EARLY RAINY SEASON (ERS) AND LATE RAINY SEASON (LRS) PRECIPITATION. COMPOSITE MAPS CONFIRM THAT THE SOUTH PACIFIC, SOUTH ATLANTIC, AND THE GULF OF MEXICO SHOW SIGNIFICANT SSTAS IN DECEMBER-JANUARY-FEBRUARY (DJF) AND MARCH-APRIL-MAY (MAM) PRIOR TO THE ERS AND THE LRS. STATISTICAL MODELS FOR SEASONAL FORECASTING OF RAINFALL AT THE ISLAND SCALE COULD BE IMPROVED BY USING THE SSTAS OF THE PACIFIC AND ATLANTIC SUBREGIONS IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY.",""

HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS (HABS) ARE AS A RESULT OF MASSIVE PROLIFERATION OF BLUE-GREEN ALGAE (CYANOBACTERIA). HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS (HABS) POSE THREATS TO BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS HUMAN HEALTH, AND DESPITE THIS WELL-KNOWN FACT, THEIR MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT ARE STILL CHALLENGING. CLIMATE CHANGE, EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, AND HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS AND PREDICTED TO BENEFITS HABS DYNAMICS IN MOST PARTS OF THE WORLD. IN TANZANIA, STUDIES OF HABS PROLIFERATION AND THEIR POSSIBLE CORRELATION WITH VARIABILITY IN CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGY STILL LAG BEHIND DESPITE HIGH DEMAND FOR DEVELOPING PREDICTING TOOLS AND PREVENTION OF HABS PROLIFERATION. THE PRESENT STUDY REPORTS ON THE RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF HABS VARIATION IN MINDU DAM LOCATED IN MOROGORO, TANZANIA USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES. IN THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARISON BETWEEN IN SITU MEASUREMENT AND OCEAN COLOR (OC2) CHLOROPHYLL-A WITH THE SURFACE REFLECTANCE'S (BAND AND BAND COMBINATIONS) OF LANDSAT 7 AND LANDSAT 8 OPERATIONAL LAND IMAGER (OLI), WAS PERFORMED. ANOTHER APPROACH INVOLVED SEARCHING FOR PATTERNS AND TRENDS, AND TELECONNECTION BETWEEN CHLOROPHYLL-A INDEX (BEST BAND RATION) AND THE CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGICAL VARIATIONS IN THE CATCHMENT. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES, SOLAR RADIATION, CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION REGISTERED SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TRENDS. WIND SPEED AND DIRECTIONS, WATER LEVELS FOR MINDU DAM SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASING TREND. ON THE OTHER HAND, RAINFALL SHOWED NO TREND. THE PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE LINK AND CAUSALITY BETWEEN THE HABS VARIATIONS AND METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS TEMPERATURES, SOLAR RADIATIONS, AND WATER LEVELS. THE STUDY, THEREFORE, CONTRIBUTES TO THE APPLICATION OF RECENT ADVANCES IN REMOTE SENSING AND RETROSPECTIVELY ANALYSIS OF BLOOM DYNAMICS AND SEARCH FOR THEIR LINK WITH CLIMATE AND HYDROLOGICAL CHANGES.",""

HOWEVER, THERE IS A LOCK-IN IN BUILT INFRASTRUCTURES THAT IS LIMITING THE RATE AT WHICH EMISSIONS CAN BE REDUCED. SELF-HEALING ASPHALT IS A NEW TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL REDUCE THE NEED FOR FOSSIL FUELS OVER THE LIFETIME OF A ROAD PAVEMENT, AT THE SAME TIME AS PROLONGING THE ROAD LIFESPAN. IN THIS STUDY WE HAVE ASSESSED THE BENEFITS OF USING SELF-HEALING ASPHALT AS AN ALTERNATIVE MATERIAL FOR ROAD PAVEMENTS EMPLOYING A HYBRID INPUT?OUTPUT-ASSISTED LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT, AS ONLY BY DETERMINING THE PLAUSIBLE SCENARIOS OF FUTURE EMISSIONS WILL POLICY MAKERS IDENTIFY PATHWAYS THAT MIGHT ACHIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION GOALS.
