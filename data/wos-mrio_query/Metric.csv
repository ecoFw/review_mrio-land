HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SECTOR POLICIES FOCUS EITHER ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE OR CONSUMPTION WHILE THE MAJORITY OF SECTORS ALONG THE TRANSMISSION WERE OVERLOOKED. THIS RESEARCH COMBINES INPUT-OUTPUT MODELLING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TO TRACK THE EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS AMONG THIRTY SECTORS OF THIRTY PROVINCES IN CHINA. BASED ON THE LARGE-DATA RESOLUTION NETWORK, A TWO-STEP NETWORK REDUCTION ALGORITHM IS USED TO EXTRACT THE BACKBONE OF THE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, NETWORK CENTRALITY METRICS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE USED TO ASSESS EACH INDIVIDUAL SECTOR'S ROLES, AND TO REVEAL THE CARBON COMMUNITIES WHERE SECTORS HAVE INTENSIVE EMISSION LINKS. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SECTORS WITH HIGH OUT-DEGREE, IN-DEGREE OR BETWEENNESS CAN ACT AS LEVERAGE POINTS FOR CARBON EMISSIONS MITIGATION. IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL ETS, THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE METALLURGY AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE HOTPOTS ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS PROVINCES AND THUS PROVINCIAL SPECIFIC TARGETED POLICIES SHOULD BE FORMED. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NINETEEN CARBON COMMUNITIES IN CHINA WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES, WHICH PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS' EXTERNAL COLLABORATION FOR SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS.",""

THE ``RAW MATERIAL EQUIVALENTS'' (RME) METRIC OF MATERIAL CONSUMPTION ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF INCLUDING THE FULL SUPPLY CHAIN (INCLUDING IMPORTS) WHEN CALCULATING NATIONAL OR PRODUCT LEVEL MATERIAL IMPACTS. THE RME CALCULATION SUFFERS FROM DATA AVAILABILITY, HOWEVER, AS QUANTITATIVE DATA ON PRODUCTION PRACTICES ALONG THE FULL SUPPLY CHAIN (IN DIFFERENT REGIONS) IS REQUIRED. HENCE, THE RME IS CURRENTLY BEING ESTIMATED BY THREE MAIN APPROACHES: (1) ASSUMING DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY IN FOREIGN ECONOMIES, (2) UTILIZING REGION-SPECIFIC LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORIES (IN A HYBRID FRAMEWORK), AND (3) UTILIZING MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT (MRIO) ANALYSIS TO EXPLICITLY COVER ALL REGIONS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WHILE THE FIRST APPROACH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO GIVE INACCURATE RESULTS, THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF THE LATTER TWO APPROACHES. WE ANALYZE RESULTS FROM TWO KEY (MRIO AND HYBRID) PROJECTS MODELING RAW MATERIAL EQUIVALENTS, ADJUSTING THE MODELS IN A STEPWISE MANNER IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTUAL ELEMENTS.

COMPARED TO OTHER DISASTERS THAT INFLICT PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS, EPIDEMICS CAN HAVE MORE DEVASTATING AND PROLONGED IMPACTS ON THE POPULATION. THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE INTERDEPENDENT ECONOMIC AND PRODUCTIVITY RISKS RESULTING FROM EPIDEMIC-INDUCED WORKFORCE ABSENTEEISM. IN PARTICULAR, WE DEVELOP A DYNAMIC INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL CAPABLE OF GENERATING SECTOR-DISAGGREGATED ECONOMIC LOSSES BASED ON DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF WORKFORCE DISRUPTIONS. AN EX POST ANALYSIS OF THE 2009 H1N1 PANDEMIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION (NCR) REVEALS THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONSEQUENCES ACROSS DIFFERENT ECONOMIC SECTORS. CONSEQUENCES ARE CATEGORIZED INTO TWO METRICS: (I) ECONOMIC LOSS, WHICH MEASURES THE MAGNITUDE OF MONETARY LOSSES INCURRED IN EACH SECTOR, AND (II) INOPERABILITY, WHICH MEASURES THE NORMALIZED MONETARY LOSSES INCURRED IN EACH SECTOR RELATIVE TO THE TOTAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT OF THAT SECTOR. FOR A SIMULATED MILD PANDEMIC SCENARIO IN NCR, TWO DISTINCT RANKINGS ARE GENERATED USING THE ECONOMIC LOSS AND INOPERABILITY METRICS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE CRITICAL SECTORS RANKED ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC LOSS METRIC COMPRISE OF SECTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO THE NCR'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (E.G., FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES). IN CONTRAST, THE MAJORITY OF THE CRITICAL SECTORS GENERATED BY THE INOPERABILITY METRIC INCLUDE SECTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH EPIDEMIC MANAGEMENT (E.G., HOSPITALS). HENCE, PRIORITIZING SECTORS FOR RECOVERY NECESSITATES CONSIDERATION OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN ECONOMIC LOSS, INOPERABILITY, AND OTHER OBJECTIVES.

ALTHOUGH QUANTIFYING AND ANALYZING THE SUSTAINABILITY IMPLICATIONS OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE, IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED SUFFICIENTLY. THEREFORE, THE OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUANTIFY THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS USING AN ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT-BASED SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK. IN THIS RESEARCH, THE COMMODITY-BY-INDUSTRY SUPPLY AND USE TABLES PUBLISHED BY THE U.S. BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, AS PART OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, ARE MERGED WITH A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL METRICS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AFTER DETERMINING THESE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT METRICS, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF U.S CONSTRUCTION SECTORS HAVE BEEN ANALYZED FROM A TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE PERSPECTIVE. WHEN ANALYZING THE TOTAL SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS BY EACH CONSTRUCTION SECTOR, ``RESIDENTIAL PERMANENT SINGLE AND MULTI-FAMILY STRUCTURES'' AND ``OTHER NON-RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES'' ARE FOUND TO HAVE THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER CONSTRUCTION SECTORS. THE ANALYSIS RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT INDIRECT SUPPLIERS OF CONSTRUCTION SECTORS HAVE THE LARGEST SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS COMPARED WITH ON-SITE ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR ALL U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS, ON-SITE CONSTRUCTION PROCESSES ARE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LESS THAN 5 \% OF TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION, WHEREAS ABOUT 95 \% OF TOTAL WATER USE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO INDIRECT SUPPLIERS. IN ADDITION, SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGHEST CARBON EMISSIONS COMPARED WITH SCOPES 1 AND 2. THEREFORE, USING NARROWLY DEFINED SYSTEM BOUNDARIES BY IGNORING SUPPLY CHAIN-RELATED IMPACTS CAN RESULT IN UNDERESTIMATION OF TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) STUDIES THAT CONSIDER ALL DIMENSIONS OF SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURES ARE STILL LIMITED, AND THE CURRENT RESEARCH IS AN IMPORTANT ATTEMPT TO ANALYZE THE TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE SUSTAINABILITY IMPACTS OF THE U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS IN A HOLISTIC WAY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT MODEL WILL COMPLEMENT PREVIOUS LCA STUDIES ON RESOURCE CONSUMPTION OF U.S. CONSTRUCTION SECTORS BY EVALUATING THEM NOT ONLY FROM ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT, BUT ALSO FROM ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVES.",""

THIS PAPER FOCUSES PARTICULARLY ON WORKFORCE DISRUPTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANES. WE EXTEND THE DYNAMIC INOPERABILITY INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL (DIIM) BY FORMULATING A WORKFORCE RECOVERY MODEL TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL INDUSTRY SECTORS. A DECISION ANALYSIS TOOL IS UTILIZED BY INTEGRATING THE ECONOMIC LOSS AND INOPERABILITY METRICS TO STUDY THE INTERDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF VARIOUS HURRICANE INTENSITIES ON VIRGINIA'S WORKFORCE SECTORS. THE EXTENDED DIIM AND AVAILABLE WORKFORCE SURVEY DATA ARE INCORPORATED IN THE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL TO SIMULATE VARIOUS HURRICANE SCENARIOS. FOR A LOW-INTENSITY HURRICANE SCENARIO, THE SIMULATED TOTAL ECONOMIC LOSS TO VIRGINIA'S INDUSTRY SECTORS DUE TO WORKFORCE ABSENTEEISM IS AROUND \$410 MILLION. EXAMPLES OF CRITICAL SECTORS THAT SUFFER THE HIGHEST LOSSES FOR THIS SCENARIO INCLUDE: (1) MISCELLANEOUS PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES; (2) FEDERAL GENERAL GOVERNMENT; (3) STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES; (4) CONSTRUCTION; AND (5) ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS PAPER ALSO EXPLORES THE INOPERABILITY METRIC, WHICH DESCRIBES THE PROPORTION IN WHICH A SECTOR CAPACITY IS DISRUPTED. THE INOPERABILITY METRIC REVEALS A DIFFERENT RANKING OF CRITICAL SECTORS, SUCH AS: (1) SOCIAL ASSISTANCE; (2) HOSPITALS AND NURSING AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES; (3) EDUCATIONAL SERVICES; (4) FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES; AND (5) FEDERAL GENERAL GOVERNMENT. RESULTS OF THE STUDY WILL HELP IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL WORKFORCE SECTORS AND CAN ULTIMATELY PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO FORMULATING PREPAREDNESS DECISIONS TO EXPEDITE DISASTER RECOVERY.

WE DEVELOP A COMPUTER-BASED DCPP TOOL TO DETERMINE THE PRIORITY FOR INVENTORY ENHANCEMENT WITH USER PREFERENCE AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AS NEW DIMENSIONS. A BASELINE INVENTORY CASE FOR THE STATE OF VIRGINIA REVEALED A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF (I) MANUFACTURING SECTORS UNDER THE INOPERABILITY OBJECTIVE AND (II) SERVICE SECTORS UNDER THE ECONOMIC LOSS OBJECTIVE. SIMULATION OF ENHANCED INVENTORY POLICIES FOR SELECTED CRITICAL MANUFACTURING SECTORS HAS REDUCED THE RECOVERY PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY FOUR DAYS AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL ECONOMIC LOSS BY \$33 MILLION. ALTHOUGH THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON ENHANCING INVENTORY LEVELS IN MANUFACTURING SECTORS, COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS IS RECOMMENDED TO MANAGE THE RESILIENCE OF THE SERVICE SECTORS.

THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF INDIRECT EFFECTS IS CENTRAL TO THIS UNDERSTANDING, AND THE RATIO OF INDIRECT FLOW TO DIRECT FLOW (I/D) IS ONE INDICATOR OF THEIR IMPORTANCE. TWO METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR CALCULATING THIS INDICATOR. THE UNIT APPROACH SHOWS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EACH SYSTEM MEMBER HAD A UNIT INPUT OR OUTPUT, WHILE THE REALIZED TECHNIQUE DETERMINES THE RATIO USING THE OBSERVED SYSTEM INPUTS OR OUTPUTS. WHEN USING THE UNIT METHOD, THE INPUT ORIENTED AND OUTPUT ORIENTED RATIOS CAN BE DIFFERENT, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO CONFLICTING RESULTS. HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT THE INPUT AND OUTPUT ORIENTED I/D RATIOS ARE IDENTICAL USING THE REALIZED METHOD WHEN THE SYSTEM IS AT STEADY STATE.

THE TOTAL DOMESTIC RESOURCE EXERGY REQUIREMENTS AMOUNTED TO 125.5 EJ, OF WHICH THE EASTERN AREA CONTRIBUTED THE LARGEST SHARE OF 44.5\%, FOLLOWED BY THE WESTERN AREA (23.9\%), THE CENTRAL AREA (23.0\%) AND THE NORTHEASTERN AREA (8.6\%). INVESTMENT WAS THE LEADING FINAL DEMAND CATEGORY, ACCOUNTING FOR 52.9\% (66.4 EJ) OF NATIONAL TOTAL EMBODIED RESOURCE USE (ERU). THE TOTAL TRADE VOLUMES OF EMBODIED RESOURCE WERE EQUIVALENT TO 69.6\% OF THE TOTAL DIRECT RESOURCE INPUT (DRI), MOSTLY TRANSFERRED FROM THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN REGIONS SUCH AS INNER MONGOLIA, SHANXI, SHAANXI AND XINJIANG TO THE EASTERN REGIONS SUCH AS JIANGSU, ZHEJIANG, GUANGDONG AND SHANGHAI. THE NORTHEASTERN AND EASTERN AREAS HAD PHYSICAL NET IMPORTS OF 1213.5 PJ AND 38452.6 PJ, WHILE THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN INLAND AREAS HAD PHYSICAL NET EXPORTS OF 6364.5 PJ AND 33301.5 PJ, RESPECTIVELY. SHANGHAI, BEIJING, ZHEJIANG, JIANGSU AND GUANGDONG HAD PROMINENT ERUS WHICH RESPECTIVELY WERE 101.6, 12.6, 11.7, 8.4 AND 4.3 TIMES OF THEIR DRIS. THE ERUS OF INNER MONGOLIA, SHAANXI, SHANXI, NINGXIA AND GUIZHOU WERE EQUAL TO ONLY 17.6\%, 25.3\%, 27.9\%, 46.0\% AND 50.2\% OF THEIR DRIS, RESPECTIVELY. REGIONAL UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT RESULTED IN IMBALANCED RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS ACROSS CHINA. THE FINDINGS CAN PROVIDE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S RESOURCE-DRIVEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MODE, AND CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING REGIONAL RESOURCE FOOTPRINTS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENT OUTCOMES UNDER THE ``NEW NORMAL ECONOMY''.",""

AN INCREASING SHARE OF THIS DEMAND IS MET THROUGH TRADE AND IMPORTS. THE UNPRECEDENTED RAPID GROWTH, EXTENT, AND COMPLEXITY OF GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS) SINCE THE 1980S HAVE RESHAPED GLOBAL TRADE. THE GVCS - AND NEW ECONOMIC PATTERNS OF REGIONALIZATION - AFFECT THE DEMANDS ON WATER, ENERGY, AND FOOD WITHIN COUNTRIES AND ACROSS GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. EAST ASIA IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST DUE TO THE REGION'S RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH, SUBSTANTIAL POPULATION SIZE, HIGH INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE REGION'S ECONOMIES, AND VARYING DEGREE OF RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. WHILE GREATER INTERDEPENDENCE ACROSS THE REGION HAS INCREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION AND TRADE, THESE ACTIVITIES REQUIRE THE INPUT OF WATER-ENERGY-FOOD AND GENERATE DISTURBANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TRANSNATIONAL INTER-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH IS UTILIZED IN A TELE-CONNECTED WATER ENERGY-FOOD NEXUS (WEFN) ANALYSIS OF THE EAST ASIA GVC TO ASSESS COMPETING DEMANDS FOR THESE RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES. THIS ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THE HIDDEN VIRTUAL FLOWS OF WATER, ENERGY, AND FOOD EMBODIED IN INTRA-REGIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL INTER-REGIONAL TRADE. CHINA'S CURRENT NATIONAL EXPORT ORIENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGY IN EAST ASIA IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FROM THE WEFN PERSPECTIVE. CHINA IS A NET VIRTUAL EXPORTER OF NEXUS RESOURCES TO JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. CHINA'S PRIORITIZATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TRADE IN LOW VALUE ADDED AND POLLUTION INTENSIVE SECTORS CONSUMES A GREAT AMOUNT OF NEXUS RESOURCES WITHIN ITS TERRITORY TO SATISFY CONSUMERS' DEMANDS IN JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. JAPAN'S KANTO AND KINKI REGIONS AND SOUTH KOREA'S SUDOKWON REGION WERE THE MAJOR BENEFICIARIES WHILE CHINA BORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF EXPORTS.

THEREFORE, INTRODUCING A NEW APPROACH, FUZZY DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS, IS CRITICAL; SINCE SUCH A METHOD COULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE RESULTS OF THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT MODELS INTO THE DECISION-MAKING FOR SUSTAINABILITY BENCHMARKING AND RANKING. IN THIS PAPER, A FUZZY DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS MODEL WAS COUPLED WITH AN INPUT OUTPUT-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO PERFORM THE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF THE 33 FOOD MANUFACTURING SECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES. SEVEN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES WERE CONSIDERED THE INPUTS AND THE TOTAL PRODUCTION AMOUNTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE OUTPUT CATEGORY, WHERE EACH FOOD MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS CONSIDERED A DECISION-MAKING UNIT. TO APPLY THE PROPOSED APPROACH, THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT RESULTS WERE FORMULATED AS FUZZY CRISP VALUED-INTERVALS AND INTEGRATED WITH FUZZY DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS MODEL, THUS, SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE INDICES WERE QUANTIFIED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT MAJORITY (31 OUT OF 33) OF THE FOOD MANUFACTURING SECTORS WERE NOT FOUND TO BE EFFICIENT, WHERE THE OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE SCORES RANGED BETWEEN 0.21 AND 1.00 (EFFICIENT), AND THE AVERAGE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE WAS FOUND TO BE 0.66. TO VALIDATE THE CURRENT STUDY'S FINDINGS, A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH THE RESULTS OF A PREVIOUS WORK WAS ALSO PERFORMED. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS THAT THE EFFECTS OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH INPUT-OUTPUT-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPROACHES CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY TACKLED WITH THE PROPOSED FUZZY DEA FRAMEWORK WHICH CAN HAVE A GREAT AREA OF APPLICATION IN RESEARCH AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE WITH ECO-EFFICIENCY AS A SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE METRIC.

HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN NO QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE UNRECOVERED WASTE THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY REINTEGRATED INTO THE ECONOMY AS MATERIALS OR PRODUCTS. THIS CAN BE INTERPRETED AS THE GAP OF MATERIAL CIRCULARITY. IN THIS PAPER WE DEFINE THE CIRCULARITY GAP OF A COUNTRY AS THE GENERATED WASTE, PLUS OLD MATERIALS REMOVED FROM STOCKS AND DURABLE PRODUCTS DISPOSED (I.E. STOCK DEPLETION), MINUS RECOVERED WASTE. WE ESTIMATED THE CIRCULARITY GAP OF 43 NATIONS AND 5 REST OF THE WORLD REGIONS IN 2011, USING THE GLOBAL, MULTIREGIONAL HYBRID-UNITS INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASE EXIOBASE V3.3. OUR RESULTS SHOW THE TRENDS OF CIRCULARITY GAP IN ACCORDANCE TO EACH REGION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CIRCULARITY GAPS OF EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA WERE BETWEEN 1.6-2.2 TONNES PER CAPITA (T/CAP), WHICH ARE MORE THAN TWICE THE GLOBAL AVERAGE GAP (0.8 T/CAP). ALTHOUGH THESE REGIONS PRESENTED THE MAJOR AMOUNT OF MATERIAL RECOVERY, THEIR CIRCULARITY GAPS WERE MOSTLY RELATED TO THE LEVELS OF STOCK DEPLETION. IN AFRICA AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS, THE CIRCULARITY GAP WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A LOW DEGREE OF RECOVERY AND STOCK DEPLETION, WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GENERATED WASTE. MOREOVER, WE DISCUSS WHICH INTERVENTION TYPES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED TO MINIMIZE THE CIRCULARITY GAP OF NATIONS.",""
