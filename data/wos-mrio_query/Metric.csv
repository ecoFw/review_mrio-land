DRIVEN BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF ENERGY IMPACT MODELLERS, POLICYMAKERS AND BUILDING DESIGN EXPERTS; A NEW HISTORICAL HIGH-SPATIAL RESOLUTION, GLOBAL GRIDDED DATASET OF DEGREE-DAYS CONSTRUCTED USING VARIOUS BASE (THRESHOLD) TEMPERATURES (T-B) IS PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY. DERIVED USING SUB-DAILY TEMPERATURE FROM A QUALITY-CONTROLLED REANALYSIS DATA PRODUCT (GLOBAL LAND DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM-GLDAS), THE DATASET CALLED `DEGDAYS\_0P25\_1970\_2018' INCLUDES MONTHLY AND ANNUAL (I) CDD; (II) HDD; AND (III) CDD COMPUTED USING WET-BULB TEMPERATURE (CDDWB) AT 0.25 DEGREES X 0.25 DEGREES GRIDDED RESOLUTION, COVERING 49 YEARS OVER THE PERIOD 1970-2018. THE T-B USED FOR ASSEMBLING DEGDAYS\_0P25\_1970\_2018 INCLUDE 18, 18.3, 22, 23, 24, 25 DEGREES C FOR CDD AND CDDWB; AND 10, 15, 15.5, 16, 17 AND 18 DEGREES C FOR HDD, RESPECTIVELY. THE DATA OF INDIVIDUAL INDICES ARE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN THE COMMONLY USED SCIENTIFIC NETWORK COMMON DATA FORM 4 (NETCDF4) AND GEOREFERENCED TAGGED IMAGE FILE (GEOTIFF) FORMATS. DEGDAYS\_0P25\_1970\_2018 FILLS GAPS IN EXISTING ENERGY INDICATORS' DATASETS BY BEING THE ONLY HIGH-RESOLUTION HISTORICAL GLOBAL GRIDDED TIME SERIES BASED ON MULTIPLE THRESHOLD TEMPERATURES, THUS OFFERING APPLICATIONS IN WIDE-RANGING CLIMATE ZONES AND THERMAL COMFORT ENVIRONMENTS. THE RICHNESS OF DEGDAYS\_0P25\_1970\_2018 LIES IN ITS FLEXIBILITY BY ALLOWING USERS TO AGGREGATE THE DEGREE-DAYS NOT ONLY AT VARYING SPATIAL SCALES (SUCH AS ADMINISTRATIVE LEVELS, NATIONAL BOUNDARIES, ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS E.G. OECD; WITH OR WITHOUT POPULATION WEIGHTS), BUT ALSO AT VARYING TEMPORAL SCALES (SUCH AS SEASONS), THEREBY OFFERING CLIMATOLOGISTS WITH A POTENTIAL TO EXAMINE GLOBAL TELECONNECTION PATTERNS MORE DISCRETELY.",""

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SECTOR POLICIES FOCUS EITHER ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE OR CONSUMPTION WHILE THE MAJORITY OF SECTORS ALONG THE TRANSMISSION WERE OVERLOOKED. THIS RESEARCH COMBINES INPUT-OUTPUT MODELLING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TO TRACK THE EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS AMONG THIRTY SECTORS OF THIRTY PROVINCES IN CHINA. BASED ON THE LARGE-DATA RESOLUTION NETWORK, A TWO-STEP NETWORK REDUCTION ALGORITHM IS USED TO EXTRACT THE BACKBONE OF THE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, NETWORK CENTRALITY METRICS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE USED TO ASSESS EACH INDIVIDUAL SECTOR'S ROLES, AND TO REVEAL THE CARBON COMMUNITIES WHERE SECTORS HAVE INTENSIVE EMISSION LINKS. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SECTORS WITH HIGH OUT-DEGREE, IN-DEGREE OR BETWEENNESS CAN ACT AS LEVERAGE POINTS FOR CARBON EMISSIONS MITIGATION. IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL ETS, THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE METALLURGY AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE HOTPOTS ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS PROVINCES AND THUS PROVINCIAL SPECIFIC TARGETED POLICIES SHOULD BE FORMED. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NINETEEN CARBON COMMUNITIES IN CHINA WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES, WHICH PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS' EXTERNAL COLLABORATION FOR SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS.",""

IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATE THE INTERNAL CLIMATE DYNAMICS OF THE ACO OVER THE LAST 21 MILLENNIA USING STABLE WATER ISOTOPES FROZEN IN ICE CORES FROM 11 ANTARCTIC DRILL SITES AS TEMPERATURE PROXIES. SPECTRAL AND TIME SERIES ANALYSES REVEAL THAT ACOS OCCURRED AT ALL 11 SITES OVER ALL TIME PERIODS EVALUATED, SUGGESTING THAT THE ACO ENCOMPASSES ALL OF ANTARCTICA. FROM THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM THROUGH THE LAST GLACIAL TERMINATION (LGT), ACO CYCLES PROPAGATED ON A MULTICENTENNIAL TIME SCALE FROM THE EAST ANTARCTIC COASTLINE CLOCKWISE AROUND ANTARCTICA IN THE STREAMLINE OF THE ANTARCTIC CIRCUMPOLAR CURRENT (ACC). THE VELOCITY OF TELECONNECTION (VT) IS CORRELATED WITH THE GEOPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DRILL SITES, INCLUDING DISTANCE FROM THE OCEAN AND TEMPERATURE. DURING THE LGT, THE VT TO COASTAL SITES DOUBLED WHILE THE VT TO INLAND SITES DECREASED FOURFOLD, CORRELATED WITH INCREASING SOLAR INSOLATION AT 65 DEGREES N. THESE RESULTS IMPLICATE TWO INTERDEPENDENT MECHANISMS OF TELECONNECTION, OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC, AND SUGGEST POSSIBLE PHYSICAL MECHANISMS FOR EACH. DURING THE WARMER HOLOCENE, ACOS ARRIVED SYNCHRONOUSLY AT ALL DRILL SITES EXAMINED, SUGGESTING THAT THE VT INCREASED WITH TEMPERATURE. BACKWARD EXTRAPOLATION OF ACO PROPAGATION DIRECTION AND VELOCITY PLACES ITS ESTIMATED GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN EAST OF ANTARCTICA, IN THE REGION OF THE STRONGEST SUSTAINED SURFACE WIND STRESS OVER ANY BODY OF OCEAN WATER ON EARTH. ACO PERIOD IS CORRELATED WITH ALL MAJOR CYCLE PARAMETERS EXCEPT CYCLE SYMMETRY, CONSISTENT WITH A FORCED, UNDAMPED OSCILLATION IN WHICH THE DRIVING ENERGY AFFECTS ALL MAJOR CYCLE METRICS. CYCLE PERIOD AND SYMMETRY ARE NOT DISCERNIBLY DIFFERENT FOR THE ACO AND AAO OVER THE SAME TIME PERIODS, SUGGESTING THAT THEY ARE THE SAME CLIMATE CYCLE. WE POSTULATE THAT THE ACO/AAO IS GENERATED BY RELAXATION OSCILLATION OF WESTERLY WIND VELOCITY FORCED BY THE EQUATOR-TO-POLE TEMPERATURE GRADIENT AND PROPAGATED REGIONALLY BY IDENTIFIED AIR-SEA-ICE INTERACTIONS.",""

THE RME CALCULATION SUFFERS FROM DATA AVAILABILITY, HOWEVER, AS QUANTITATIVE DATA ON PRODUCTION PRACTICES ALONG THE FULL SUPPLY CHAIN (IN DIFFERENT REGIONS) IS REQUIRED. HENCE, THE RME IS CURRENTLY BEING ESTIMATED BY THREE MAIN APPROACHES: (1) ASSUMING DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGY IN FOREIGN ECONOMIES, (2) UTILIZING REGION-SPECIFIC LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORIES (IN A HYBRID FRAMEWORK), AND (3) UTILIZING MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT OUTPUT (MRIO) ANALYSIS TO EXPLICITLY COVER ALL REGIONS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER IT STILL EXISTS IN THE CMIP PHASE 5 (CMIP5) MODELS AND, IF SO, WHAT CAUSES THESE BIASES? OUR EVALUATION OF HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS SHOWS THAT SOME MODELS STILL UNDERESTIMATE RAINFALL OVER AMAZONIA. DURING THE DRY SEASON, BOTH CONVECTIVE AND LARGE-SCALE PRECIPITATION IS UNDERESTIMATED IN MOST MODELS. GFDL-ESM2M AND IPSL NOTABLY SHOW MORE PENTADS WITH NO RAINFALL. DURING THE WET SEASON, LARGE-SCALE PRECIPITATION IS STILL UNDERESTIMATED IN MOST MODELS. IN THE DRY AND TRANSITION SEASONS, MODELS WITH MORE REALISTIC MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND SURFACE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION GENERALLY HAVE MORE REALISTIC RAINFALL TOTALS. IN SOME MODELS, OVERESTIMATES OF RAINFALL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADJACENT TROPICAL AND EASTERN PACIFIC ITCZS. HOWEVER, IN OTHER MODELS, TOO MUCH SURFACE NET RADIATION AND A RESULTANT HIGH BOWEN RATIO APPEARS TO CAUSE UNDERESTIMATES OF RAINFALL. DURING THE TRANSITION SEASON, LOW PRE-SEASONAL LATENT HEAT, HIGH SENSIBLE FLUX, AND A WEAKER INFLUENCE OF COLD AIR INCURSIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DRY BIAS. ABOUT HALF THE MODELS CAN CAPTURE, BUT OVERESTIMATE, THE INFLUENCES OF TELECONNECTION. BASED ON A SIMPLE METRIC, HADGEM2-ES OUTPERFORMS OTHER MODELS ESPECIALLY FOR SURFACE CONDITIONS AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION. GFDL-ESM2M HAS THE STRONGEST DRY BIAS PRESUMABLY DUE TO ITS OVERESTIMATE OF MOISTURE DIVERGENCE, INDUCED BY OVERESTIMATED ITCZS IN ADJACENT OCEANS, AND REINFORCED BY POSITIVE FEEDBACKS BETWEEN REDUCED CLOUDINESS, HIGH BOWEN RATIO AND SUPPRESSION OF RAINFALL DURING THE DRY SEASON, AND TOO WEAK INCURSIONS OF EXTRATROPICAL DISTURBANCES DURING THE TRANSITION SEASON.",""

DIAGNOSTICS AND SKILL METRICS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED TO ASSESS THE TIME-MEAN, CLIMATOLOGICAL ANNUAL CYCLE, INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY, AND INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN MODELING THESE ASPECTS OF THE MONSOON, THOUGH THERE IS NO SINGLE MODEL THAT BEST REPRESENTS ALL OF THESE ASPECTS OF THE MONSOON. THE CMIP5 MULTI-MODEL MEAN (MMM) IS MORE SKILLFUL THAN THE CMIP3 MMM FOR ALL DIAGNOSTICS IN TERMS OF THE SKILL OF SIMULATING PATTERN CORRELATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OBSERVATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR RAINFALL/CONVECTION THE MMM OUTPERFORMS THE INDIVIDUAL MODELS FOR THE TIME MEAN, THE INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY OF THE EAST ASIAN MONSOON, AND INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY. THE PATTERN CORRELATION OF THE TIME (PENTAD) OF MONSOON PEAK AND WITHDRAWAL IS BETTER SIMULATED THAN THAT OF MONSOON ONSET. THE ONSET OF THE MONSOON OVER INDIA IS TYPICALLY TOO LATE IN THE MODELS. THE EXTENSION OF THE MONSOON OVER EASTERN CHINA, KOREA, AND JAPAN IS UNDERESTIMATED, WHILE IT IS OVERESTIMATED OVER THE SUBTROPICAL WESTERN/CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN. THE ANTI-CORRELATION BETWEEN ANOMALIES OF ALL-INDIA RAINFALL AND NIO3.4 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE IS OVERLY STRONG IN CMIP3 AND TYPICALLY TOO WEAK IN CMIP5. FOR BOTH THE ENSO-MONSOON TELECONNECTION AND THE EAST ASIAN ZONAL WIND-RAINFALL TELECONNECTION, THE MMM INTERANNUAL RAINFALL ANOMALIES ARE WEAK COMPARED TO OBSERVATIONS. THOUGH SIMULATION OF INTRASEASONAL VARIABILITY REMAINS PROBLEMATIC, SEVERAL MODELS SHOW IMPROVED SKILL AT REPRESENTING THE NORTHWARD PROPAGATION OF CONVECTION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TILTED BAND OF CONVECTION THAT EXTENDS FROM INDIA TO THE EQUATORIAL WEST PACIFIC. THE MMM ALSO WELL REPRESENTS THE SPACE-TIME EVOLUTION OF INTRASEASONAL OUTGOING LONGWAVE RADIATION ANOMALIES. CAUTION IS NECESSARY WHEN USING GPCP AND CMAP RAINFALL TO VALIDATE (1) THE TIME-MEAN RAINFALL, AS THERE ARE SYSTEMATIC DIFFERENCES OVER OCEAN AND LAND BETWEEN THESE TWO DATA SETS, AND (2) THE TIMING OF MONSOON WITHDRAWAL OVER INDIA, WHERE THE SMOOTH SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION SEEN IN INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT DATA IS BETTER REALIZED IN CMAP DATA COMPARED TO GPCP DATA.",""

HOUSEHOLDS' WELFARE IMPACTS FROM ECONOMY-WIDE ELECTRICITY PRICE SHOCKS ARE SIMULATED AGAINST A BASELINE THAT IS CALIBRATED TO ACTUAL HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC AND ELECTRICITY SERVICE CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ACTUAL ELECTRICITY BUDGETS, BLOCK TIER PRICES AND SUPPLY RATIONING.

LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS CAN BE SHIELDED FROM MITIGATION IMPACTS WITHOUT LOSSES IN AGGREGATE WELFARE TO THE EXTENT THAT REGULATORS CAN RECOVER MITIGATION COSTS THROUGH INDUSTRIAL PRICE INCREASES. REGULATORS' FLEXIBILITY TO DISTRIBUTE COSTS ACROSS HOUSEHOLDS IS CONSTRAINED BY INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS MIGRATION OFF THE GRID.

FOR A SIMULATED MILD PANDEMIC SCENARIO IN NCR, TWO DISTINCT RANKINGS ARE GENERATED USING THE ECONOMIC LOSS AND INOPERABILITY METRICS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE CRITICAL SECTORS RANKED ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIC LOSS METRIC COMPRISE OF SECTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE THE MOST TO THE NCR'S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (E.G., FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES). IN CONTRAST, THE MAJORITY OF THE CRITICAL SECTORS GENERATED BY THE INOPERABILITY METRIC INCLUDE SECTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH EPIDEMIC MANAGEMENT (E.G., HOSPITALS).

HOWEVER, THE SHORT OBSERVATIONAL RECORD MAKES UNEQUIVOCAL IDENTIFICATION OF THESE SURFACE CONNECTIONS CHALLENGING. TO OVERCOME THIS, WE USE A MULTICENTURY CONTROL SIMULATION OF A CLIMATE MODEL WITH A REALISTIC, SPONTANEOUSLY GENERATED QBO TO EXAMINE TELECONNECTIONS WITH EXTRATROPICAL WINTER SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERNS. USING A 30-HPA INDEX OF THE QBO, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OBSERVED TELECONNECTION WITH THE ARCTIC OSCILLATION (AO) IS LIKELY TO BE REAL, AND A TELECONNECTION WITH THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO) IS PROBABLE, BUT NOT CERTAIN. SIMULATED QBO-AO TELECONNECTIONS ARE ROBUST, BUT APPEAR WEAKER THAN IN OBSERVATIONS. DESPITE THIS, INCONSISTENCY WITH THE OBSERVATIONAL RECORD CANNOT BE FORMALLY DEMONSTRATED. TO ASSESS THE ROBUSTNESS OF OUR RESULTS, WE USE AN ALTERNATIVE MEASURE OF THE QBO, WHICH SELECTS QBO PHASES WITH WESTERLY OR EASTERLY WINDS EXTENDING OVER A WIDER RANGE OF ALTITUDES THAN PHASES SELECTED BY THE SINGLE-LEVEL INDEX. WE FIND INCREASED STRENGTH AND SIGNIFICANCE FOR BOTH THE AO AND NAO RESPONSES, AND BETTER REPRODUCTION OF THE OBSERVED SURFACE TELECONNECTION PATTERNS. FURTHER, THIS QBO METRIC REVEALS THAT THE SIMULATED AO RESPONSE IS INDEED LIKELY TO BE WEAKER THAN OBSERVED.

BECAUSE THE METRICS OF COLDNESS ARE BASED ON MULTIPLE LAYERS IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THEY PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSMENT OF WARMING THAN IS PROVIDED BY SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURES ALONE. THE NEGATIVE TRENDS OF PCAM AND NHC ARE STRONGER (AS A \% PER DECADE) WHEN THE THRESHOLD IS 245 KRATHER THAN 280 K, INDICATING THAT THE LOSS OF EXTREMELY COLD AIR IS HAPPENING AT A FASTER RATE THAN THE LOSS OF MODERATELY COLD AIR.

TO DATE, IDENTIFYING THE CRITICAL TRANSMISSION SECTORS FOR SUPPLY-CHAIN WATER RESOURCES PRESSURE MITIGATION HAS BEEN UNDER-EXAMINED. TO FILL THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE, WE USE A BETWEENNESS-BASED METHOD IN COMBINATION WITH THE STANDARD INPUT OUTPUT TABLE EXTENDED WITH WATER-RESOURCE SECTOR ACCOUNTS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY TRANSMISSION SECTORS USING ZHANGYE CITY IN THE HEIHE RIVER BASIN, CHINA AS AN EXAMPLE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SECTORS WITH LOW RANKINGS OF THE PRODUCTION-BASED INDICATOR DO NOT CONSUME LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER RESOURCES TO DIRECTLY GENERATE PRODUCTS, WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT THESE SECTORS HAVE LIMITED SCOPE FOR REDUCING WATER-RESOURCE CONSUMPTION. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT THOSE SECTORS HAVING HIGHER BETWEENNESS-BASED WATER USE BUT LOWER CONSUMPTION-BASED AND PRODUCTION-BASED WATER USE MERIT CLOSE ATTENTION BECAUSE THESE SECTORS TRANSMIT RELATIVELY LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER RESOURCES EMBODIED IN THEIR INTERMEDIATE INPUTS FROM WATER-INTENSIVE UPSTREAM INDUSTRIAL SECTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, IMPROVING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN THESE SECTORS HAS AN INDIRECT EFFECT BY LOWERING THE CONSUMPTION OF UPSTREAM WATER RESOURCES. THIS STUDY ALSO SHOWS THAT THE BETWEENNESS-BASED INDICATOR IS ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEYOND THAT GIVEN BY THE USUAL METRICS DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTION AND DEMAND SIDES. MOREOVER, THE TYPOLOGY OF WATER USE THAT WE INNOVATIVELY GENERATE IS ABLE TO INFORM CORRESPONDING AND TARGETED SECTOR-SPECIFIC POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR MITIGATING WATER RESOURCES PRESSURE.",""

SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT IS THE MAIN METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING SOCIAL ASPECTS BASED ON A LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH. USING THIS FRAMEWORK, A HYBRID MODEL INTEGRATING SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS WAS INTRODUCED TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT SOCIAL EFFECTS OF BIOREFINERY SCENARIOS CONSIDERING WORKERS AS THE STAKEHOLDER CATEGORY. JOB CREATION, OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS, WAGE PROFILE, EDUCATION PROFILE, AND GENDER PROFILE WERE SELECTED AS THE MAIN INVENTORY INDICATORS. A CASE STUDY OF THREE SCENARIOS CONSIDERING VARIATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING SUGARCANE STRAW RECOVERY AND SECOND-GENERATION ETHANOL PRODUCTION, FOR INSTANCE) WAS CARRIED OUT FOR EVALUATING PRESENT FIRST-GENERATION (1G-BASIC, 1G-OPTIMIZED) AND FUTURE FIRST- AND SECOND-GENERATION ETHANOL PRODUCTION (1G2G). THE 1G-BASIC SCENARIO LEADS TO HIGHER JOB CREATION LEVELS OVER THE SUPPLY CHAIN MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF AGRICULTURAL STAGE WHOSE WORKERS ARE MOSTLY EMPLOYED IN SUGARCANE MANUAL OPERATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, 1G-OPTIMIZED AND 1G2G PRESENT SUPPLY CHAINS ARE MORE RELIANT ON THE MANUFACTURING, TRADE, AND SERVICES SECTORS WHOSE WORKERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER LEVEL OF OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS, HIGHER AVERAGE WAGES, HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL, AND MORE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE. THE USE OF A NOVEL HYBRID APPROACH INTEGRATING SOCIAL LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (SLCA) AND INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IOA) WAS USEFUL TO QUANTITATIVELY DISTINGUISH THE SOCIAL EFFECTS OVER DIFFERENT PRESENT AND FUTURE SUGARCANE BIOREFINERY SUPPLY CHAINS.

AN INCREASING SHARE OF THIS DEMAND IS MET THROUGH TRADE AND IMPORTS. THE UNPRECEDENTED RAPID GROWTH, EXTENT, AND COMPLEXITY OF GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS (GVCS) SINCE THE 1980S HAVE RESHAPED GLOBAL TRADE. THE GVCS - AND NEW ECONOMIC PATTERNS OF REGIONALIZATION - AFFECT THE DEMANDS ON WATER, ENERGY, AND FOOD WITHIN COUNTRIES AND ACROSS GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. EAST ASIA IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST DUE TO THE REGION'S RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH, SUBSTANTIAL POPULATION SIZE, HIGH INTERDEPENDENCE OF THE REGION'S ECONOMIES, AND VARYING DEGREE OF RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. WHILE GREATER INTERDEPENDENCE ACROSS THE REGION HAS INCREASED THE EFFICIENCY OF PRODUCTION AND TRADE, THESE ACTIVITIES REQUIRE THE INPUT OF WATER-ENERGY-FOOD AND GENERATE DISTURBANCES IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THE TRANSNATIONAL INTER-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT APPROACH IS UTILIZED IN A TELE-CONNECTED WATER ENERGY-FOOD NEXUS (WEFN) ANALYSIS OF THE EAST ASIA GVC TO ASSESS COMPETING DEMANDS FOR THESE RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES. THIS ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES THE HIDDEN VIRTUAL FLOWS OF WATER, ENERGY, AND FOOD EMBODIED IN INTRA-REGIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL INTER-REGIONAL TRADE. CHINA'S CURRENT NATIONAL EXPORT ORIENTED ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGY IN EAST ASIA IS NOT SUSTAINABLE FROM THE WEFN PERSPECTIVE. CHINA IS A NET VIRTUAL EXPORTER OF NEXUS RESOURCES TO JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. CHINA'S PRIORITIZATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TRADE IN LOW VALUE ADDED AND POLLUTION INTENSIVE SECTORS CONSUMES A GREAT AMOUNT OF NEXUS RESOURCES WITHIN ITS TERRITORY TO SATISFY CONSUMERS' DEMANDS IN JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA. JAPAN'S KANTO AND KINKI REGIONS AND SOUTH KOREA'S SUDOKWON REGION WERE THE MAJOR BENEFICIARIES WHILE CHINA BORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF EXPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE, NET VIRTUAL EXPORTS FROM CHINA'S EAST REGION INCLUDED OVER 1.2 BILLION M(3) OF SCARCE WATER AND 61.3 MILLION METRIC (CO2 EQUIVALENT) TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES (I.E. CO2, NH4, AND N2O) AND 2 MILLION METRIC TONS OF SOX EMISSIONS. TRADE IS AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR OVERCOMING RESOURCE BOTTLENECKS, BUT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ENVIRONMENTAL LINKAGES, REGIONAL SPECIALIZATION IS NOT NECESSARILY MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL. THIS ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES A MISMATCH BETWEEN REGIONAL WATER-ENERGY-FOOD AVAILABILITY AND FINAL RESOURCE CONSUMPTION AND THE LACK OF ATTENTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IN NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGIES.

THIS CAN POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY OF NATIONS AS ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON WATER ESPECIALLY FOR AGRICULTURAL COUNTRIES. IN RESPONSE TO THIS, THE CONCEPTS OF VIRTUAL WATER AND WATER FOOTPRINT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AS METRICS FOR MEASURING THE WATER INTENSITY OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND NATIONS. RESEARCHERS HAVE THUS LOOKED INTO VIRTUAL WATER TRADE FLOWS AS A POTENTIAL STRATEGY FOR ALLEVIATING WATER SCARCITY. THE PAPER AIMS TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - ENVIRONMENTALLY EXTENDED INPUT-OUTPUT MODELS (IOMS) ARE OFTEN USED TO ANALYZE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THIS WORK THUS DEVELOPS A MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL FOR OPTIMIZING VIRTUAL WATER TRADE BETWEEN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, PRODUCT DEMANDS AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. FINDINGS - A CASE STUDY ON AGRICULTURE CROP PRODUCTION AND TRADE IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE PHILIPPINES IS UTILIZED TO DEMONSTRATE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY DOES NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT A WATER-SCARCE REGION TO PRODUCE LESS WATER-INTENSIVE CROPS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE MODEL USES AN INPUT-OUTPUT FRAMEWORK WHOSE FIXED COEFFICIENTS REFLECT A FIXED TECHNOLOGICAL STATE. AS SUCH, THE MODEL IS BEST USED FOR SHORT-TERM PROJECTIONS, OR PROJECTIONS FOR MATURE TECHNOLOGICAL STATE (I.E. WHERE NO MAJOR GAINS IN EFFICIENCY OR YIELD CAN BE FORESEEN). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PROPOSED MODELING FRAMEWORK CAN BE USED IN ANY GEOGRAPHIC REGION (PROVIDED RELEVANT STATISTICAL DATA ARE AVAILABLE FOR CALIBRATION) TO PROVIDE DECISION SUPPORT FOR OPTIMAL USE OF LIMITED WATER RESOURCES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE MODEL PROPOSED IN THIS WORK HAS GENERAL APPLICABILITY TO THE OPTIMAL PLANNING OF AGRO-INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS UNDER WATER FOOTPRINT CONSTRAINTS.

IN THIS PAPER, A FUZZY DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS MODEL WAS COUPLED WITH AN INPUT OUTPUT-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPROACH TO PERFORM THE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF THE 33 FOOD MANUFACTURING SECTORS IN THE UNITED STATES. SEVEN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CATEGORIES WERE CONSIDERED THE INPUTS AND THE TOTAL PRODUCTION AMOUNTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE OUTPUT CATEGORY, WHERE EACH FOOD MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS CONSIDERED A DECISION-MAKING UNIT. TO APPLY THE PROPOSED APPROACH, THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT RESULTS WERE FORMULATED AS FUZZY CRISP VALUED-INTERVALS AND INTEGRATED WITH FUZZY DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS MODEL, THUS, SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE INDICES WERE QUANTIFIED. RESULTS INDICATED THAT MAJORITY (31 OUT OF 33) OF THE FOOD MANUFACTURING SECTORS WERE NOT FOUND TO BE EFFICIENT, WHERE THE OVERALL SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE SCORES RANGED BETWEEN 0.21 AND 1.00 (EFFICIENT), AND THE AVERAGE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE WAS FOUND TO BE 0.66. TO VALIDATE THE CURRENT STUDY'S FINDINGS, A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH THE RESULTS OF A PREVIOUS WORK WAS ALSO PERFORMED. THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK IS THAT THE EFFECTS OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH INPUT-OUTPUT-BASED LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT APPROACHES CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY TACKLED WITH THE PROPOSED FUZZY DEA FRAMEWORK WHICH CAN HAVE A GREAT AREA OF APPLICATION IN RESEARCH AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE WITH ECO-EFFICIENCY AS A SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE METRIC.

THIS IS STRONGLY RELATED TO THE SAT VARIATIONS IN THE COASTAL AREA SOUTH OF 40AU BROKEN VERTICAL BAR N IN THE EAWM REGION. THE TEMPERATURE VARIATION IN THE EAWM REGION IS ALSO REPRESENTED BY THE TWO DOMINANT TEMPERATURE MODES, WHICH ARE CALLED THE NORTHERN TEMPERATURE MODE (NTM) AND THE SOUTHERN TEMPERATURE MODE (STM). COMPARED TO 19 EXISTING EAWMIS AND OTHER WELL-KNOWN TELECONNECTION PATTERNS, THE UBI SHOWS THE STRONGEST CORRELATION WITH THE NTM, WHILE THE WPI SHOWS AN EQUALLY STRONG CORRELATION WITH THE STM AS FOUR EAWMIS.

THE MODEL FORMULATION TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE DYNAMIC INTERDEPENDENCIES ACROSS SECTORS IN AN ECONOMIC SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ECONOMIC SECTORS. FROM A MACROECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, THE RISK OF THE INFLUENZA DISASTER CAN BE MODELED USING TWO RISK METRICS. FIRST, THERE IS THE LEVEL OF INOPERABILITY, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IDEAL PRODUCTION LEVEL AND THE DEGRADED PRODUCTION LEVEL. SECOND, THE ECONOMIC LOSS METRIC REPRESENTS THE FINANCIAL VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCED OUTPUT. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS WORK REVOLVES AROUND THE MODELING OF UNCERTAINTIES TRIGGERED BY NEW PERTURBATIONS TO INTERDEPENDENT ECONOMIC SECTORS WITHIN AN INFLUENZA PANDEMIC TIMELINE.

TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, SUPPLY AND USE TABLES PUBLISHED BY THE U.S. BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WERE MERGED WITH 16 MACRO-LEVEL SUSTAINABILITY METRICS. A HYBRID TBL-LCA MODEL WAS BUILT TO EVALUATE THE LIFE-CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE OF USING WMA TECHNOLOGIES IN CONSTRUCTION OF ASPHALT PAVEMENTS. THE IMPACTS ON THE SUSTAINABILITY WERE CALCULATED IN TERMS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC (IMPORT, INCOME, GROSS OPERATING SURPLUS, GOVERNMENT TAX, WORK-RELATED INJURIES, AND EMPLOYMENT) AND ENVIRONMENTAL (WATER WITHDRAWAL, ENERGY USE, CARBON FOOTPRINT, HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION, TOXIC RELEASES INTO AIR, AND LAND USE). A STOCHASTIC COMPROMISE PROGRAMMING MODEL WAS THEN DEVELOPED FOR FINDING THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF DIFFERENT PAVEMENT TYPES FOR THE U.S. HIGHWAYS.

IN MANY OF THESE INSTANCES THE DEMISE DATE VARIATIONS OF THE SEASON ALSO HAVE A BEARING ON THE PRECEDING SEASONAL LENGTH AND SEASONAL RAINFALL ANOMALIES. HOWEVER, WE FIND THAT VARIATIONS OF THE ONSET AND THE DEMISE DATES ARE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER ACROSS PF AND IN ALL SEASONS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE ICONIC ENSO TELECONNECTION OVER PF IS EXCLUSIVE TO THE SEASONAL RAINFALL ANOMALIES AND IT DOES NOT AFFECT THE VARIATIONS IN THE LENGTH OF THE WINTER SEASON. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS, WE STRONGLY SUGGEST MONITORING AND PREDICTING THE VARIATIONS IN THE LENGTHS OF THE SEASONS OVER PF AS IT IS NOT ONLY AN IMPORTANT METRIC OF CLIMATE VARIABILITY BUT ALSO BENEFICIAL TO REDUCE A VARIETY OF RISKS OF IMPACT OF ANOMALOUS SEASONAL CLIMATE VARIATIONS.",""

VARIOUS SKILL METRICS ARE DERIVED FROM TELECONNECTION DIAGNOSTICS INCLUDING FIVE PERFORMANCE-BASED METRICS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE PATTERN, AMPLITUDE, EAST-WEST POSITION, PERSISTENCE, AND CONSISTENCY OF MJO TELECONNECTIONS AND ADDITIONAL TWO PROCESS-ORIENTED METRICS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CHARACTERIZE THE LOCATION AND INTENSITY OF THE ANOMALOUS ROSSBY WAVE SOURCE (RWS). THE PROPOSED TELECONNECTION SKILL METRICS ARE USED TO COMPARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOREAL WINTER MJO TELECONNECTIONS (500-HPA GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT ANOMALY) OVER THE PACIFIC-NORTH AMERICA (PNA) REGION IN 29 GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS (GCMS). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT CURRENT GCMS GENERALLY PRODUCE MJO TELECONNECTIONS THAT ARE STRONGER, MORE PERSISTENT, AND EXTEND TOO FAR TO THE EAST WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE OBSERVED IN REANALYSIS. IN GENERAL, MODELS SIMULATE MORE REALISTIC TELECONNECTION PATTERNS WHEN THE MJO IS IN PHASES 2-3 OR PHASES 7-8, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A DIPOLE CONVECTION PATTERN OVER THE INDIAN OCEAN AND WESTERN TO CENTRAL PACIFIC. THE HIGHER MODEL SKILL FOR PHASES 2, 7, AND 8 MAY BE DUE TO THESE PHASES PRODUCING MORE CONSISTENT TELECONNECTION PATTERNS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL MJO EVENTS THAN OTHER PHASES, ALTHOUGH THE CONSISTENCY IS LOWER IN MOST MODELS THAN OBSERVED. MODELS THAT SIMULATE REALISTIC RWS PATTERNS BETTER REPRODUCE MJO TELECONNECTION PATTERNS.",""

THE DOMESTIC GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS CAUSED BY HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING THE ASSOCIATED FIXED CAPITAL, WERE CALCULATED USING INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS. IN 2011 THE TOTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF THESE SERVICES WAS 62.5 X 10(6) METRIC TONS OF CO2 EQUIVALENT (MTCO(2)E), WHICH IS 4.6\% OF TOTAL DOMESTIC GHG EMISSIONS. MEDICAL SERVICES INVOLVING HOSPITALIZATION ACCOUNTED FOR THE GREATEST SHARE, AT 15.7 MTCO(2)E. THE SECOND HIGHEST CATEGORY, MEDICAL SERVICES WITHOUT HOSPITALIZATION, ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS: 14.2 MTCO(2)E. HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN EMISSIONS PER PATIENT BETWEEN THESE TWO CATEGORIES WAS CONSIDERABLE. ON AVERAGE, EMISSIONS PER PATIENT FOR MEDICAL SERVICES (HOSPITALIZATION) WERE 12 TCO(2)E/PATIENT, WHEREAS FOR MEDICAL SERVICES (NON-HOSPITALIZATION) THEY WERE ONLY 2.1 TCO(2)E/PATIENT, OR 5.4 TIMES LESS. IN TERMS OF TYPE OF MEDICAL CONDITION, THE GREATEST ANNUAL EMISSIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (6.2 MTCO(2)E) AND NEOPLASM (4.0 MTCO(2)E). IN TERMS OF AGE, EMISSIONS ATTRIBUTED TO PATIENTS AGED 65 AND OVER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN HALF OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE EMISSIONS. BY 2015, THE TOTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT HAD INCREASED TO 72.0 MTCO(2)E, A RISE OF OVER 15\% IN FOUR YEARS. ALTHOUGH MEDICAL CARE AND PHARMACEUTICALS ARE THE MAIN FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS INCREASE, EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH NURSING SERVICES HAVE ALSO RISEN, SUGGESTING THAT DEMOGRAPHIC AGING MAY BE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GHG EMISSIONS. AS A COUNTERMEASURE, THE POTENTIAL ANNUAL GHG MITIGATION ACHIEVABLE THROUGH AVOIDANCE OF UNUSED PRESCRIBED MEDICINES RESULTING IN WASTE WAS ESTIMATED AT 1.24 MTCO(2)E, COMPARABLE WITH THE TOTAL CARBON FOOTPRINT OF HOME MEDICINES.

GIVEN THEIR IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF AIR QUALITY AND SUSTAINABLE AND SAFER MOVEMENT OF GOODS, HEAVY-DUTY TRUCKS (HDTS), CARRYING THE MAJORITY OF U.S. FREIGHT, ARE CONSIDERED AN IDEAL DOMAIN FOR THE APPLICATION OF CAV TECHNOLOGY. AN INPUT-OUTPUT (IO) MODEL IS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE EORA DATABASE-A DETAILED IO DATABASE THAT CONSISTS OF NATIONAL IO TABLES, COVERING ALMOST THE ENTIRE GLOBAL ECONOMY. USING THE EORA-BASED IO MODEL, THIS STUDY QUANTIFIES AND ASSESSES THE ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF AUTOMATED DIESEL AND BATTERY ELECTRIC HDTS BASED ON 20 MACRO-LEVEL INDICATORS. THE LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCES OF THESE HDTS ARE THEN COMPARED TO THAT OF A CONVENTIONAL DIESEL HDT. THE STUDY FINDS AN AUTOMATED DIESEL HDT TO CAUSE 18\% MORE FATALITIES THAN AN AUTOMATED ELECTRIC HDT. THE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (GWP) OF AUTOMATED DIESEL HDTS IS ESTIMATED TO BE 4.7 THOUSAND METRIC TONS CO2-EQ. HIGHER THAN THAT OF AUTOMATED ELECTRIC HDTS. THE HEALTH IMPACT COSTS RESULTING FROM AN AUTOMATED DIESEL HDT ARE TWO TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF AN AUTOMATED ELECTRIC HDT. OVERALL, THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT AUTOMATION BRINGS IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SELECTED SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS OF HDTS SUCH AS GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL, LIFE CYCLE COST, GDP, DECREASE IN IMPORT, AND INCREASE IN INCOME. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TRADE-OFFS PARTICULARLY BETWEEN MINERAL AND FOSSIL RESOURCE LOSSES AND ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO COMPLICATE DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES REGARDING THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY.",""

HOWEVER, THESE ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ANALYSE THE THREAT TO SOCIETY OF A NEW FIRE REGIME CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGHER OCCURRENCE OF VERY LARGE EVENTS. TO OVERCOME THIS WEAKNESS, WE PROPOSE THE USE OF A CONCENTRATION INDEX (CIB) WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY SPATIO-TEMPORAL PATTERNS. THE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION OF BA FOLLOWS A NEGATIVE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION ALMOST EVERYWHERE, IN WHICH A SMALL MINORITY OF FE IS RESPONSIBLE OF THE MAJORITY OF BA. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL BEHAVIOUR OF BA IS ANALYSED IN WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN EUROPE, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON PORTUGAL, SPAIN, FRANCE AND ITALY, USING DATA FROM THE EUROPEAN FOREST FIRE INFORMATION SYSTEM AND NATIONAL WILDFIRE DATABASES. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE CI HAS BEEN APPLIED TO WILDFIRE EVENTS. THIS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT, IN MOST MEDITERRANEAN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THE AMOUNT OF BA IS INCREASINGLY RELATED WITH A LOWER NUMBER OF FIRES. THE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF CIB SHOWS HIGH VARIABILITY IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES ANALYSED IN EUROPE. PORTUGAL AND SPAIN SHOW INCREASING SIGNIFICANT TRENDS OF CIB + 7.6\% (P-VALUE = 0.001) AND + 1.3\% PER DECADE (P-VALUE = 0.003). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS FOR PORTUGAL, SPAIN AND ITALY ARE ALSO FOUND BETWEEN THE ANNUAL CIB AND SEVERAL TELECONNECTION INDICES.

THIS CAN BE INTERPRETED AS THE GAP OF MATERIAL CIRCULARITY. IN THIS PAPER WE DEFINE THE CIRCULARITY GAP OF A COUNTRY AS THE GENERATED WASTE, PLUS OLD MATERIALS REMOVED FROM STOCKS AND DURABLE PRODUCTS DISPOSED (I.E. STOCK DEPLETION), MINUS RECOVERED WASTE. WE ESTIMATED THE CIRCULARITY GAP OF 43 NATIONS AND 5 REST OF THE WORLD REGIONS IN 2011, USING THE GLOBAL, MULTIREGIONAL HYBRID-UNITS INPUT-OUTPUT DATABASE EXIOBASE V3.3. OUR RESULTS SHOW THE TRENDS OF CIRCULARITY GAP IN ACCORDANCE TO EACH REGION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CIRCULARITY GAPS OF EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA WERE BETWEEN 1.6-2.2 TONNES PER CAPITA (T/CAP), WHICH ARE MORE THAN TWICE THE GLOBAL AVERAGE GAP (0.8 T/CAP). ALTHOUGH THESE REGIONS PRESENTED THE MAJOR AMOUNT OF MATERIAL RECOVERY, THEIR CIRCULARITY GAPS WERE MOSTLY RELATED TO THE LEVELS OF STOCK DEPLETION.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE ADVANCED VERY HIGH RESOLUTION RADIOMETER (AVHRR) VERSION 3 NDVI (NDVI3G) AND CLIMATE RESEARCH UNIT (CRU) DATASETS FOR PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE WERE USED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE FACTORS ON VEGETATION DYNAMICS OVER EAST AFRICA FROM 1982 TO 2015. PEARSON CORRELATION OF NDVI AND CLIMATE FACTORS WERE ALSO EXPLORED TO INVESTIGATE THE SHORT (OCTOBER - DECEMBER) RAINY SEASONS. THE PHENOLOGICAL METRICS OF THE REGION WAS ALSO EXTRACTED TO UNDERSTAND THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF VEGETATION. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A POSITIVE LINEAR TREND OF 14.50 X 10(-4) FOR MEAN ANNUAL NDVI BEFORE 1998, WHERE AS A NEGATIVE LINEAR TREND OF -9.64 X 10(-4) WAS FOUND AFTER 1998. THE BREAK POINT (BP) WAS OBTAINED IN 1998, WHICH SUGGESTS TO NONLINEAR RESPONSES OF NDVI TO CLIMATE AND NON-CLIMATE DRIVERS. ENSO-VEGETATION IN EL-NINO YEARS SHOWED A WEAK TELECONNECTION BETWEEN ENSO AND VEGETATION GROWTH CHANGES OF CROPLANDS. ALSO, THE ANALYZED CORRELATIONS ON NDVI DATA RESULTED TO THE HIGHER CORRELATION BETWEEN NDVI AND PRECIPITATION THAN THAT WITH TEMPERATURE.
