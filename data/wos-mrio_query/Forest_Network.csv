IN THIS PAPER, FOREST RESOURCE INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL AND FOREST RESOURCE METABOLISM NETWORK MODEL ARE ESTABLISHED TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS RELATED TO FOREST RESOURCES. A PROMISING INDICATOR NAMED EXPLOITATION INDEX IS DEVELOPED TO REVEAL THE WEAKER SECTORS IN THE ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS, WHICH WILL FURTHER HELP TO PROVIDE BETTER CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND INTEGRATED STRATEGIC MEASURES. GUANGDONG IS TAKEN AS AN EXAMPLE TO VERIFY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE MODEL AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PRIMARY MANUFACTURING CONSUMES MORE DIRECT TIMBER, WHILE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING AND THE SERVICE SECTOR UTILIZE TIMBER INDIRECTLY. IN ADDITION, GUANGDONG FOREST METABOLISM SYSTEM SHOWS A NEGATIVE CORRELATION AND THE WHOLE NETWORK DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE MUTUALISM STATE, LEADING TO COMPETITION RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PAIRWISE SECTORS THAT SHOULD NOT APPEAR, SUCH AS FORESTRY SECTOR AND PAPERMAKING AND PAPER PRODUCTS SECTOR. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE THE CORRESPONDING REFERENCE FOR HELPING THE DECISION MAKERS TO ALLOCATE FOREST RESOURCES AND COORDINATE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.",""

UNCOVERING WATER TRANSFER NETWORK CAN HELP IMPROVING WATER RESOURCE COORDINATION DEVELOPMENT FROM THE PERSPECTIYE OF WATER-TRADE NEXUS. AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK BY UNITING THE INTERREGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (IRIO) ANALYSIS AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (SNA) IN THIS STUDY CAN ESTIMATE NOT ONLY THE SCALE AND STRUCTURE OF WATER TRADE PATTERN, BUT ALSO THE TOPOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTIC OF WATER TRANSFER NETWORK OF YREB. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE RANK OF PRODUCTION-BASED VIRTUAL WATER VOLUME WAS ROUGHLY IN THE ORDER OF MIDDLE, LOWER AND UPPER REACHES EXCEPT JIANGSU, WHILE THE RANK OF CONSUMPTION BASED VIRTUAL WATER VOLUME WAS IN THE ORDER OF LOWER, MIDDLE AND UPPER REACHES. THE PROVINCIAL VIRTUAL WATER EXTERNAL DEPENDENCE IN YREB WAS NOT WELL CONSISTENT WITH THE WATER RESOURCE ENDOWMENT. WATER TRANSFER NETWORK WAS CONSTRUCTED ON BASIS OF THE INTER-PROVINCIAL VIRTUAL WATER TRANSFERS BETWEEN EVERY TWO PROVINCES INSIDE YREB. FURTHERMORE, THE WATER TRANSFER NETWORK ASSESSMENT RESULTS ILLUSTRATED THE NETWORK STRUCTURAL FORM AND REVEALED THE NETWORK PROPERTY AND CHARACTERISTICS. INSIDE YREB, SHANGHAI, JIANGSU, ZHEJIANG, ANHUI AND JIANGXI WERE PREDOMINANT IN THE WATER TRANSFER NETWORK (FROM DEGREE CENTRALITY), WHILE JIANGXI, HUBEI, HUNAN AND ANHUI ACTED AS THE IMPORTANT MEDIUM AND BRIDGE (FROM BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY). THE AFAF SECTOR (AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND FISHERY) AND INDUSTRY SECTOR OF JIANGXI, AND THE INDUSTRY SECTOR OF HUBEI AND JIANGSU WERE THE CRITICAL EXPORTERS IN THE NETWORK. JIANGSU RECEIVED LARGE AMOUNTS OF VIRTUAL WATER FROM MANY GOOD HUBS AND ALSO TRANSFERRED MUCH TO MANY GOOD AUTHORITIES WHEN ACTED AS BAGMEN IN THE NETWORK. SOME PROVINCES RECEIVED LARGE VIRTUAL WATER FLOW BUT PROVIDED FEW TO OTHERS, SUCH AS SHANGHAI, AND THE AFAF SECTORS OF MOST PROVINCES TRANSFERRED MUCH TO OTHERS. THUS, THE RESEARCH RESULTS WOULD HELP UNDERSTAND THE REGIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TRANSFER IN THE HIDDEN NETWORK LINKAGES OF INTERPROVINCIAL AND INTERSECTORAL VIRTUAL WATER FLOWS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER LTD.

IN LCA, THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF RESOURCE EXTRACTION AND EMISSIONS DURING A PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE IS QUANTIFIED. TO BETTER QUANTIFY THIS IMPACT, FIRST THE ALTERATION OF ECOSYSTEMS INDUCED BY THOSE PROCESSES NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR. SECOND, THE FLOW NETWORKS OF ECOSYSTEMS, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FORMATION OF THE EXTRACTED RESOURCES, SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE. TO ACHIEVE THESE TWO OBJECTIVES, A TOOL WAS SELECTED WHICH STUDIES THE FLOW NETWORKS OF ECOSYSTEMS: ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA). IN ENA, TOTAL SYSTEM INDICATORS ARE CALCULATED WHICH ASSESS AN ECOSYSTEM'S FUNCTIONING (E.G. CYCLING). ALTERATIONS OF ECOSYSTEMS CAN BE REPRESENTED BY CHANGES IN THE VALUES OF THOSE INDICATORS. ENA IS BASED ON THE COMPUTATIONAL FRAMEWORK OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS (IA). THIS FRAMEWORK IS ALSO USED IN LCA ALLOWING FOR A POSSIBLE EXTENSION OF A PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE IN AN LCA WITH THE ECOSYSTEM FLOW NETWORKS OF ENA. THE ENA/IOA FRAMEWORK ITSELF WAS REVISED AND IMPROVED IN THIS STUDY TO BETTER FIT IN AN LCA FRAMEWORK, PRIOR TO INTEGRATION AND APPLICATION IN LCA. THE MAJOR ADAPTATION WAS TO ENABLE PHYSICAL COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT OF THE STUDIED (ECO)SYSTEM. THIS ALLOWS FOR A SPECIFICATION OF DESTINATIONS AND SOURCES OF EXPORT AND IMPORT FLOWS, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS DESIRED IN LCA TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THESE FLOWS. NEXT TO THAT, THE ADAPTED FRAMEWORK WAS MADE APPLICABLE TO NON-STEADY-STATE SYSTEMS BY APPLYING FINN'S CONCEPT (1976, 1977), IN WHICH INCREASE, INCREMENT, AND DECREASE, DEPLETION, IN STOCK ARE CONSIDERED ABSTRACT EXPORT AND IMPORT FLOWS, RESPECTIVELY. AS AN EXAMPLE, THE ADAPTED ENA FRAMEWORK WAS APPLIED TO A FOREST ECOSYSTEM. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO STANDARDS YET FOR THE DIFFERENT CHOICES IN THE ENA METHODOLOGY, WHICH CAN HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE INDICATOR VALUES. HENCE, DEFINING SUCH STANDARDS IS A NEXT IMPORTANT RESEARCH STEP. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""
