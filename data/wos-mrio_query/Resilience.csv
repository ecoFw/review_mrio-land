MODEL RESULTS INDICATE THAT RURAL REGIONS ARE MORE RESISTANT TO RECESSIONARY SHOCKS THAN URBAN REGIONS. THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPACE-SPECIFIC ABILITY OF SECTORS TO WITHSTAND ECONOMIC SHOCKS PORTRAYED THE RESILIENCE OF AGRICULTURE, WHILE FOOD INDUSTRY, ALTHOUGH ITS IMPACT OVERTIME DECLINED, MANAGED TO INCREASE ITS EMPLOYMENT IN SEVEN OUT OF THIRTEEN REGIONS. THE TOURISM SECTOR CONTRACTED BUT SHOWED MORE RESILIENCE IN THE ISLAND REGIONS THAN IN THE CONTINENTAL REGIONS. THE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE EFFECTS OF THE RECESSIONARY SHOCKS RE-EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR TARGETED AND DIFFERENTIATED REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES.",""

THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT RESEARCH FOCUSES ON URBAN OR COMMUNITY ASSET SYSTEMS. TO PROVIDE A FULLY INTEGRATED APPROACH, ONE NEEDS TO DELINEATE THE FOCUS OF ASSET MANAGEMENT AT A CATCHMENT SCALE, TO INCLUDE THE NATURAL CAPITAL. THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER INTRODUCES SUCH AN APPROACH, WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (E-RIO) ANALYSIS AT ITS CORE. THE NOVELTY OF THE WORK IS THE CONCEPTUALISATION OF A CATCHMENT AS A COMPLEX ASSET SYSTEM, COMPRISING OF MULTIPLE SUBSYSTEMS. THIS EXPANDS THE APPLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL MODELLING TECHNIQUES IN INTEGRATED CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AND WATER ACCOUNTING. THE CATCHMENT METABOLISM MODELLING SCHEMA CREATED IN THIS PAPER SERVES ASSET, WATER RESOURCES AND CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE SCHEMA FORMS THE GROUNDS FOR STRUCTURED COLLABORATION AMONG EXPERTS FOR INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING. IN THIS PAPER THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE MODELLING SCHEMA ALONG WITH THE TECHNIQUES USED ARE PRESENTED. ALIVE' INDUSTRIAL EXAMPLE FROM THE UK WATER SECTOR (POOLE HARBOUR CATCHMENT) IS USED TO DEMONSTRATE ITS APPLICATION. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.

WHEN CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM IN A BROAD SENSE, THE ASSESSMENT OF TECHNICAL DEPENDENCIES AMONG ENGINEERED SYSTEMS CAN BE SUPPORTED BY THE ANALYSIS OF ECONOMICAL RELATIONSHIPS. A KEY TOOL TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE IS TO EXPLOIT THE INPUT- OUTPUT APPROACH PROPOSED BY WASSILY LEONTIEF FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF AN ECONOMY. RECENTLY, THE INPUT- OUTPUT APPROACH WAS EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITED TO ASSESS THE RESILIENCE OF ECONOMIES AGAINST CRITICAL EVENTS THAT MAY AFFECT SOME SECTORS AND RIPPLE THROUGH NEIGHBORING ECONOMIC SEGMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR VULNERABILITY, INERTIA, AND CENTRALITY TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY. BUILDING ON AN EXISTING APPROACH, THIS PAPER CONSIDERS A DYNAMIC INOPERABILITY INPUT- OUTPUT MODEL WITH INVENTORIES, EXAMINED ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO ENSURE EXTENDED SERVICE CONTINUITY DESPITE THE INOPERABILITY OF SOME SECTORS. REFERRING TO THIS MODEL, THE AUTHORS FIRST INTRODUCE A METHOD FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE RESILIENCE PARAMETER DESCRIBING THE ELASTICITY OF THE SECTORS WITH RESPECT TO SERVICE PERTURBATIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE AUTHORS STUDY AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF INVENTORY LEVELS ABLE TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL RESILIENCE TO SELECTED CRITICAL EVENTS.(C) 2016 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.",""

IN ADDITION TO THE THREE ASPECTS OF PROMOTING ACCESS, RENEWABLES, AND EFFICIENCY, THE DIMENSION OF RESILIENCE IN ENERGY SYSTEMS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDERED. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESILIENT ENERGY SYSTEMS REQUIRES A QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PRACTICES UNDERLYING SUCH SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY, IN LINE WITH THE INCREASING GLOBALIZATION OF TRADE, THERE REMAINS A CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP ON THE LINK BETWEEN EMBODIED ENERGY IN THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF TRADED GOODS. TO BRIDGE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE INVESTIGATE THE RESILIENCE OF GLOBAL ENERGY SYSTEMS THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF A DIVERSITY MEASURE OF GLOBAL EMBODIED ELECTRICITY TRADE BASED ON MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) NETWORKS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RESEARCH LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO UTILIZE HIGH RESOLUTION MRIO DATA SETS IN ASSESSING THE RESILIENCE OF NATIONAL ENERGY SYSTEMS. THIS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT SECURE AND RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION REQUIRES THE DIVERSIFICATION OF NOT ONLY ENERGY GENERATION BUT ALSO ENERGY IMPORTS. THIS RESEARCH WILL LAY THE GROUND FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN THE GOVERNANCE OF RESILIENCE IN GLOBAL ENERGY NETWORKS. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) IDENTIFIES A LIST OF 16 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS (CIS) WHOSE INCAPACITY DUE TO DISRUPTIONS WOULD HAVE A DEBILITATING IMPACT ON THE NATION'S ECONOMY. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG CIS ON THE RESILIENCE OF THE US ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. WE DEVELOP A-FRAMEWORK THAT COMBINES THE EMPIRICAL ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT (EIO) MODEL WITH GRAPH THEORY BASED TECHNIQUES FOR UNDERSTANDING INTERDEPENDENCIES, INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND RESILIENCE IN THE US ECONOMIC SYSTEM. BY REPRESENTING THE US ECONOMY AS A NETWORK, WE ARE ABLE TO ANALYZE ITS TOPOLOGY BY SEPARATELY LOOKING AT ITS UNWEIGHTED AND WEIGHTED FORMS. TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE US EIO NETWORK SUGGESTS THAT IT EXHIBITS SMALL WORLD PROPERTIES FOR THE UNWEIGHTED CASE, AND IN THE WEIGHTED CASE, THE THROUGHPUT OF INDUSTRY SECTORS FOLLOWS A POWER-LAW WITH AN EXPONENTIAL CUTOFF. IMPLICATIONS OF THESE TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER. WE ALSO SIMULATE HYPOTHETICAL DISRUPTIONS ON CIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY INDUSTRIAL SECTORS THAT EXPERIENCE THE LARGEST ECONOMIC IMPACTS, AND TO QUANTIFY SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITY IN ECONOMIC TERMS. IN ADDITION, INSIGHTS FROM COMMUNITY DETECTION AND HYPOTHETICAL DISRUPTION SCENARIOS HELP ASSESS VULNERABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES TO DISRUPTIONS ON INDIVIDUAL CIS. THESE METHODOLOGIES ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHTS REGARDING THE EXTENT OF COUPLING BETWEEN EACH CIS IN THE US EIO NETWORK. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE OBSERVE THAT EXCESSIVE INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES OF CIS RESULTS IN HIGH SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITY. THIS INFORMATION CAN GUIDE POLICYMAKERS TO DESIGN POLICIES THAT IMPROVE RESILIENCE OF ECONOMIC NETWORKS, AND EVALUATE POLICIES THAT MIGHT INDIRECTLY INCREASE COUPLING BETWEEN CIS.

WORLDWIDE SMALLHOLDERS ARE SUBJECT TO EXPANDED TELECOUPLING WHEREBY THEIR SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE LINKED TO LARGE-SCALE SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS. THE PRESENT RESEARCH USES THE SYNTHESIS OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE SMALLHOLDER TELECOUPLING THROUGH THE LINKAGES STEMMING FROM THE GLOBAL-LEVEL INTEGRATION OF MARKETS (COMMODITY, LABOR, FINANCE), URBANIZATION, GOVERNANCE, AND TECHNOLOGY. THESE TELECOUPLING FORCES ARE OFTEN DISADVANTAGEOUS TO SMALLHOLDERS WHILE CERTAIN CONDITIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE POTENTIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS. CASE STUDIES WERE CHOSEN TO DESCRIBE SUSTAINABILITY OPPORTUNITIES AND LIMITS INVOLVING SMALLHOLDER PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF HIGH-AGROBIODIVERSITY ANDEAN MAIZE AMID TELECOUPLED MIGRATION (BOLIVIA), THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL ECO-CERTIFICATION IN SMALLHOLDER COFFEE-GROWING AND AGROFORESTS (COLOMBIA), SMALLHOLDER ORGANIC DAIRY PRODUCTION IN LARGE-SCALE MARKETS AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (UPPER MIDWEST, U.S.A.), AND SMALLHOLDERS' GLOBAL NICHE COMMODITY PRODUCTION OF ARGAN OIL (MOROCCO). THESE CASE STUDIES ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE KEY CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FACED BY SMALLHOLDERS IN TELECOUPLING AND TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. THIS FRAMEWORK SPECIFIES THE INTEGRATED ROLES OF GLOBAL SYSTEMS TOGETHER WITH INFLUENTIAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OPERATING AT MULTIPLE SCALES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THE FRAMEWORK ALSO INTEGRATES THE LOCAL DYNAMICS OF SMALLHOLDERS' MULTIPLE LAND USE UNITS AND THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION. SPATIAL SPILLOVER EFFECTS IN SMALLHOLDER LANDSCAPES ARE AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT. THIS FRAMEWORK FURTHER ESTABLISHES THE UN-ROMANTIC, NONTELEOLOGICAL, AND ANTIFETISHISTIC VIEW OF SMALLHOLDERS. IT PROVIDES SPECIFIC INSIGHTS ON THE MULTILEVEL DYNAMICS OF SMALLHOLDER TELECOUPLING AND POTENTIAL SUSTAINABILITY OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN STRENGTHEN LIVELIHOODS, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, AND FOOD AND NUTRITIONAL SECURITY. THESE INSIGHTS ARE CONCLUDED TO BE VALUABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL, AGRICULTURAL, AND FOOD SCIENTISTS AND SCHOLARS (BOTH BIOGEOPHYSICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES), POLICY MAKERS, INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSTS, DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS AND PRACTITIONERS, SOCIAL JUSTICE ACTIVISTS, AND OTHERS SEEKING TO ADVANCE GLOBAL SUSTAINABILITY INCLUDING SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT.",""

HOWEVER, ITS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IS UNCLEAR. ADAPTATION HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY URGENT IN A CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING CLIMATE, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF CLIMATE-CHANGE-RELATED DAMAGES. ON THE BASIS OF A BRIEF REVIEW OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION LITERATURE, WE SUGGEST THAT IE CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FOLLOWING TWO ASPECTS. FIRST, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE, IE CAN HELP US DETERMINE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE INTERACTS WITH OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND HOW THE INTERACTIONS MAY AGGRAVATE (OR MODERATE) ITS DIRECT IMPACTS OR WHETHER THEY MAY SHIFT BURDEN TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. SECOND, IE METHODOLOGIES CAN HELP US QUANTIFY THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES, IDENTIFY MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE ADAPTATION. FURTHER, WE FIND THAT SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE (E.G., TRANSPORT, ENERGY, AND WATER SUPPLY) AND AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. BECAUSE THESE SECTORS ARE ALSO THE MAIN DRIVERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, HOW TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE CLIMATE-RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DESERVES SPECIAL ATTENTION IN FUTURE IE STUDIES. OVERALL, IE THINKING AND METHODOLOGIES HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION RESEARCH AND POLICY QUESTIONS, AND EXPLORING THIS GROWING FIELD WILL, IN TURN, INSPIRE IE DEVELOPMENT.",""

THE MODEL COMPUTES THE IMPACTS OF RANDOM ENERGY PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS ON THE ENTIRE MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT SYSTEM IN THE FORM OF FINAL DEMAND DEFICITS. WE THEN PROPOSE A FORMULATION TO EVALUATE THE ENERGY RESILIENCE OF THE SYSTEM BASED ON COMPUTING THE LARGEST SET OF DISRUPTIONS, OR WHAT IS TERMED AS RESILIENCE GUARANTEE LEVELS, THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED BY THE SYSTEM WITHIN GIVEN DEMAND DEFICIT BUDGETS.

HOWEVER, A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK WHICH INCORPORATES BOTH IN A MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING (MCDM) PROCESS IS YET TO BE DEVELOPED PARTICULARLY FOR MORE RECENT STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS DIAGRIDS. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A COUPLED RESILIENCE- AND SUSTAINABILITY-BASED DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK FOR SEISMIC DESIGN AND REHABILITATION OF BUILDING STRUCTURES. FEMA METHOD FOR INTENSITY-BASED AND TIME-BASED LOSS, DOWNTIME, AND CASUALTY ESTIMATION ARE USED TO EVALUATE SEISMIC ASSET, TIME, AND LIFE LOSSES. ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT METHOD IS ADAPTED TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS DUE TO EARTHQUAKES, AS WELL. AIMING TO STUDY THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN VARIOUS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF EARTHQUAKES, AN MCDM FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED BASED ON ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS, MULTI-ATTRIBUTE UTILITY THEORY, AND TECHNIQUE FOR ORDER PREFERENCE BY SIMILARITY TO IDEAL SOLUTION (TOPSIS). THE FRAMEWORK IS USED TO STUDY THE RESILIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF ARCHETYPE STEEL DIAGRID BUILDINGS IN A HIGH SEISMIC REGION. SIX SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES INCLUDING MINIMUM ASSET, TIME, LIFE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS AND MAXIMUM RESILIENCE ARE STUDIED. A SURVEY IS CONDUCTED TO FIND THE WEIGHT FACTORS FOR EACH CRITERION FOR EACH SCENARIO. RESULTS SHOW THAT IN AN MCDM FRAMEWORK, THE BENEFITS OF SUSTAINABLE DESIGN TECHNIQUES CAN OUTWEIGH POSSIBLE SHORTCOMINGS DUE TO STRUCTURAL CONFIGURATION AND PERFORMANCE.",""
