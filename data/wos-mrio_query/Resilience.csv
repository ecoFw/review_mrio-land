THE MODEL COMPUTES THE IMPACTS OF RANDOM ENERGY PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS ON THE ENTIRE MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT SYSTEM IN THE FORM OF FINAL DEMAND DEFICITS. WE THEN PROPOSE A FORMULATION TO EVALUATE THE ENERGY RESILIENCE OF THE SYSTEM BASED ON COMPUTING THE LARGEST SET OF DISRUPTIONS, OR WHAT IS TERMED AS RESILIENCE GUARANTEE LEVELS, THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED BY THE SYSTEM WITHIN GIVEN DEMAND DEFICIT BUDGETS. A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY IS THEN PERFORMED USING A 3-REGION-42-SECTOR MODEL BASED ON CHINA'S 2012 MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT REGIONAL TRADE BARRIERS, COAL-TO-GAS SWITCH POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL EFFICIENCY OF SELECTED ENERGY-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES CAN INFLUENCE CHINA'S ENERGY RESILIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS CAN PROVIDE THE POLICY-MAKERS IMPORTANT GUIDANCE ON IMPROVING ENERGY RESILIENCE IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

A REVIEW OF TRANSFORMATION APPROACHES TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY SHOWS THAT THESE DO NOT (SUFFICIENTLY) LINK PROCESSES OF CHANGE AT THE MICRO LEVEL TO DEEP LEVERAGES OF CHANGE IN WIDER SYSTEM STRUCTURES. ADDRESSING THIS RESEARCH GAP, WE DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR A SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION THAT CONNECTS THE MACRO AND THE MICRO LEVEL AND HELPS TO BRIDGE PROCESS-ORIENTED AND STRUCTURAL APPROACHES TO TRANSFORMATION. AT THE MACRO LEVEL, THE OBJECTIVES OF INTER- AND INTRAGENERATIONAL JUSTICE NEED TO BE PURSUED BY CHALLENGING THE CENTRAL PARADIGMS THAT CONSTITUTE UNSUSTAINABLE TRAJECTORIES. TO MAKE THE FRAMEWORK CONCRETE AND APPLICABLE IN PRACTICE, WE PROPOSE A PRELIMINARY SET OF EVALUATION PRINCIPLES FOR THE MICRO AND MESO LEVEL THAT REFLECT THESE NORMATIVE OBJECTIVES AND HELP TO MEASURE THE TRANSFORMATIVE CHARACTER AND TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGE PROCESSES. THE EXAMPLE OF THE EUROPEAN ORGANIC BREEDING NETWORK ILLUSTRATES THE APPLICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK. AN ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS RESEARCH THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF ITS TRANSFORMATIVE QUALITY IN LIGHT OF THE INCUMBENT PARADIGMS CAN MAKE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO TRANSFORMATION RESEARCH.",""

HOWEVER, A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK WHICH INCORPORATES BOTH IN A MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION-MAKING (MCDM) PROCESS IS YET TO BE DEVELOPED PARTICULARLY FOR MORE RECENT STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS DIAGRIDS. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES A COUPLED RESILIENCE- AND SUSTAINABILITY-BASED DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK FOR SEISMIC DESIGN AND REHABILITATION OF BUILDING STRUCTURES. FEMA METHOD FOR INTENSITY-BASED AND TIME-BASED LOSS, DOWNTIME, AND CASUALTY ESTIMATION ARE USED TO EVALUATE SEISMIC ASSET, TIME, AND LIFE LOSSES. ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT METHOD IS ADAPTED TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS DUE TO EARTHQUAKES, AS WELL. AIMING TO STUDY THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN VARIOUS ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF EARTHQUAKES, AN MCDM FRAMEWORK IS PROPOSED BASED ON ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS, MULTI-ATTRIBUTE UTILITY THEORY, AND TECHNIQUE FOR ORDER PREFERENCE BY SIMILARITY TO IDEAL SOLUTION (TOPSIS). THE FRAMEWORK IS USED TO STUDY THE RESILIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF ARCHETYPE STEEL DIAGRID BUILDINGS IN A HIGH SEISMIC REGION. SIX SCENARIOS WITH DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES INCLUDING MINIMUM ASSET, TIME, LIFE, OR ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS AND MAXIMUM RESILIENCE ARE STUDIED. A SURVEY IS CONDUCTED TO FIND THE WEIGHT FACTORS FOR EACH CRITERION FOR EACH SCENARIO. RESULTS SHOW THAT IN AN MCDM FRAMEWORK, THE BENEFITS OF SUSTAINABLE DESIGN TECHNIQUES CAN OUTWEIGH POSSIBLE SHORTCOMINGS DUE TO STRUCTURAL CONFIGURATION AND PERFORMANCE.",""

THIS PAPER FOCUSES PARTICULARLY ON WORKFORCE DISRUPTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANES. WE EXTEND THE DYNAMIC INOPERABILITY INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL (DIIM) BY FORMULATING A WORKFORCE RECOVERY MODEL TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL INDUSTRY SECTORS. A DECISION ANALYSIS TOOL IS UTILIZED BY INTEGRATING THE ECONOMIC LOSS AND INOPERABILITY METRICS TO STUDY THE INTERDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF VARIOUS HURRICANE INTENSITIES ON VIRGINIA'S WORKFORCE SECTORS. THE EXTENDED DIIM AND AVAILABLE WORKFORCE SURVEY DATA ARE INCORPORATED IN THE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL TO SIMULATE VARIOUS HURRICANE SCENARIOS. FOR A LOW-INTENSITY HURRICANE SCENARIO, THE SIMULATED TOTAL ECONOMIC LOSS TO VIRGINIA'S INDUSTRY SECTORS DUE TO WORKFORCE ABSENTEEISM IS AROUND \$410 MILLION. EXAMPLES OF CRITICAL SECTORS THAT SUFFER THE HIGHEST LOSSES FOR THIS SCENARIO INCLUDE: (1) MISCELLANEOUS PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES; (2) FEDERAL GENERAL GOVERNMENT; (3) STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES; (4) CONSTRUCTION; AND (5) ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS PAPER ALSO EXPLORES THE INOPERABILITY METRIC, WHICH DESCRIBES THE PROPORTION IN WHICH A SECTOR CAPACITY IS DISRUPTED. THE INOPERABILITY METRIC REVEALS A DIFFERENT RANKING OF CRITICAL SECTORS, SUCH AS: (1) SOCIAL ASSISTANCE; (2) HOSPITALS AND NURSING AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES; (3) EDUCATIONAL SERVICES; (4) FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES; AND (5) FEDERAL GENERAL GOVERNMENT. RESULTS OF THE STUDY WILL HELP IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL WORKFORCE SECTORS AND CAN ULTIMATELY PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO FORMULATING PREPAREDNESS DECISIONS TO EXPEDITE DISASTER RECOVERY.

AS SUCH, HISTORIC PERIODS OF CLIMATIC AND ECONOMIC VOLATILITY CAN BE USED AS A WAY OF DEVELOPING FRAMEWORKS FOR ANALYZING TODAY'S PREDICAMENT. WESTERN EUROPE'S ``MIDDLE AGES'' (CIRCA 11-14TH CENTURY) MAY BE ONE SUCH CASE. BY THE 12TH CENTURY, MEDIEVAL EUROPE HAD SHIFTED FROM THE SUBSISTENCE AGRARIAN ECONOMY THAT EMERGED FOLLOWING THE COLLAPSE OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE TO ONE WHERE SPATIALLY DISPERSED TRADE IN AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES HELPED SUPPORT A COMPLEX SOCIETY THAT DEVOTED CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES TO CULTURAL WORKS. THIS SHIFT WAS FACILITATED BY NEW INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS CENTRED ON MONASTIC ORDERS THAT PROVIDED ACCESS TO BOTH NEW AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS TRADE ROUTES. THESE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO POPULATION GROWTH AND LAND CLEARING. ALL OF THESE FACTORS INCREASED THE WEALTH OF SOCIETY BUT ALSO CONCENTRATED THIS WEALTH IN A SMALL NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DEPENDENT ON AN EVER-INCREASING AND EXPLOITED HINTERLAND FOR RESOURCES. ULTIMATELY, THIS CREATED A TIGHTLY COUPLED CONTINENT-WIDE SUBSISTENCE SYSTEM THAT WAS VULNERABLE TO THE WEATHER, ECONOMIC AND DISEASE SHOCKS OF THE 14TH CENTURY WHEN EUROPE'S POPULATION DECLINED BY PERHAPS 50\%.

THE FRAMEWORK INCLUDES SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS OF CHANGE, GOING BEYOND THE CONCEPT OF ``SUSTAINABILITY'' TO ESTABLISH A PARADIGM OF ``RESILIENT EXPLOITATION'' THAT CALCULATES THE CAPACITY OF LANDSCAPE EXPLOITATION SYSTEMS TO SURVIVE IN UNCERTAIN AND VARIABLE HUMAN AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. THE MODEL IS HIGHLY AGGREGATED, CONSISTING OF TWO STATE VARIABLES: (1) HUMAN-MADE CAPITAL AND LABOUR (H) AND (2) NATURAL CAPITAL (N). DEPENDING ON THE PARAMETERS, THE MODEL DISPLAYS A SINGLE NON-TRIVIAL EQUILIBRIUM, TWO EQUILIBRIA, OR STABLE LIMIT CYCLES. OUR ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE STRATEGIES THAT EXPLOITERS EMPLOY, THROUGH VARYING THEIR INVESTMENT IN H, AND HOW THIS AFFECTS RESILIENCE OF THE SYSTEM. WE MEASURE RESILIENCE AS THE SIZE OF THE BASIN OF ATTRACTION NEAR A DESIRABLE EQUILIBRIUM AND THE RETURN TIME FOLLOWING SMALL PERTURBATIONS. FOUR GENERAL STRATEGIES ARE ANALYSED AND DISCUSSED USING GRAZING SYSTEMS AS A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE: (1) CONSTANT STOCKING RATE, (2) MAINTAINING GRASS STOCK, (3) CONSTANT UTILIZATION RATE, AND (4) A NON-LINEAR, COMPOUND STRATEGY. LIKE PREVIOUS MODELS OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES, MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE YIELD AND PROFIT ARE DETERMINED BY PROPERTIES OF THE RENEWABLE RESOURCE, SO ALL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES YIELD IDENTICAL LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND IDENTICAL EQUILIBRIA. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES DRASTICALLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM'S RESILIENCE. WE ASSESS THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF THE DISPARATE OBJECTIVES OF RESILIENCE AND PROFITABILITY USING MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION AND DEMONSTRATE THAT RESILIENCE DECREASES RAPIDLY AS MAXIMUM PROFIT IS APPROACHED. THUS, THE SAME STABLE AND SUSTAINABLE EQUILIBRIUM POINT IN AN EXPLOITATION SYSTEM WILL BE MORE OR LESS RESILIENT DEPENDING ON THE EXPLOITER'S STRATEGY. TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DOES NOT CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF THE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY EMPLOYED TO DRIVE THE SYSTEM TOWARDS THESE LONG-TERM EQUILIBRIA, AND THEREFORE MISSES LARGE DIFFERENCES IN DYNAMICAL BEHAVIOUR AWAY FROM EQUILIBRIUM. THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE STEADY STATES IN THESE NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS RESULTS IN THE POTENTIAL FOR A DISCONTINUOUS ``THRESHOLD'' IN RESILIENCE, TO ONE SIDE OF WHICH RESILIENCE IS MAINTAINED, WHILE ON THE OTHER RESILIENCE AND PRODUCTION ARE GREATLY DEGRADED. WE FURTHER DISCUSS HOW SUBSIDIES MIGHT INCREASE OR DECREASE RESILIENCE OF EXPLOITATION SYSTEMS BY AFFECTING AN EXPLOITER'S STRATEGY. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

IN ITS FIRST PHASE OF OPERATION (1993-2003) LOICZ BEGAN A FUNDAMENTAL INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON BIOPHYSICAL DIMENSIONS, INCLUDING SEMINAL ASSESSMENTS OF COASTAL SEAS AS NET SOURCES OR SINKS OF ATMOSPHERIC CO2, RIVER DISCHARGE TO THE OCEANS, AND BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODELLING. IN THE SECOND GENERATION OF LOICZ (2004-2014), INCREASED ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF THE COAST, INVOLVING THE INCLUSION OF CROSS-CUTTING THEMES SUCH AS COASTAL GOVERNANCE, SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS, ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS AND ACTIVITIES AROUND CAPACITY BUILDING AND THE PROMOTION OF EARLY CAREER SCIENTISTS. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A SYNTHESIS OF THIS WORK AND LOOKS FORWARD TO THE FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR THE PROJECT. WITH THE TRANSITION TO FUTURE EARTH, THERE IS A PARADIGM SHIFT EMERGING. THE NEW VISION IS TO SUPPORT TRANSFORMATION TO A SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT FUTURE FOR SOCIETY AND NATURE ON THE COAST, BY FACILITATING INNOVATIVE, INTEGRATED AND SOLUTIONS-ORIENTED SCIENCE. REALISING THIS VISION TAKES LOICZ INTO A THIRD GENERATION: TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF CO-DESIGNING, CO-PRODUCING AND CO-IMPLEMENTING KNOWLEDGE FOR COASTAL RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY. LOICZ AS FUTURE EARTH COASTS WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS `HOTSPOTS' OF COASTAL VULNERABILITY, FOCUSING ON THEMES OF DYNAMIC COASTS, HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE COAST, AND PATHWAYS TO GLOBAL COASTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND CONSTRAINTS THEREOF.

EFFICIENCY AND RESILIENCE HAVE BEEN COMPARED IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS, BUT THE DATA AND MATERIALS HAVE MAINLY BEEN DERIVED FROM NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS. THE ACTUAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THIS COMPARISON WITH DATA AND MATERIALS FROM HUMAN ECONOMIC SYSTEMS IS AN IMPORTANT RESEARCH THEME FOR ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS. FURTHERMORE, EFFICIENCY DEFINED AS ECO-EFFICIENCY IS MISSING FROM RESILIENCE RESEARCH. THIS PAPER STUDIES RESILIENCE AND ECO-EFFICIENCY IN SOCIETAL ENERGY SYSTEMS. ECO-EFFICIENCY IS DEFINED AS ENERGY PRODUCED PER CO2 EMISSIONS AND INCINERATION ASH GENERATED. FOR RESILIENCE, WE USE THE DIVERSITY OF FUEL TYPES IN ENERGY SYSTEMS, IN PARTICULAR THE EVENNESS OF FUELS IN EACH FUEL TYPE CATEGORY. EMPIRICAL MATERIALS FROM THE DISTRICT HEATING ENERGY SYSTEM OF SOUTHERN LAPLAND IN FINLAND ENCOMPASSING SIX MUNICIPALITIES ARE PRESENTED. WHAT IF-SCENARIOS SHOW THAT, IN GENERAL, DIVERSITY AND ECO-EFFICIENCY SEEM TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER, I.E., THERE IS A CORRELATION. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM FOOD WEB STUDIES IN ECOLOGY WHERE THE MATERIAL FLOWS ARE PRIMARILY BIOMASS. IN HUMAN ENERGY SYSTEMS, LITHOSPHERE DERIVED MATERIALS ARE USED ALONGSIDE BIOMASS, IN OUR CASE STUDY FOSSIL COAL, OIL AS WELL AS PEAT, WHICH IS A SEMI-FOSSIL FUEL. THE DIFFERENCE MIGHT ALSO BE EXPLAINED DUE TO THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN HUMAN ECONOMIC SYSTEMS. FOR POLICY AND BUSINESS STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STUDY THE CASE SYSTEM WITH TWO INTERDEPENDENT SYSTEM BOUNDARIES; THE SUBSYSTEM LEVEL OF THE CAPITAL CITY ROVANIEMI AND THE LARGER SIX MUNICIPALITY REGIONAL SYSTEM TO WHICH ROVANIEMI BELONGS. POLICY PLANNING AND BUSINESS STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT WOULD GAIN IF THE ACTORS INVOLVED WOULD APPROACH THE SYSTEM WITH ENLARGED SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SYSTEM BOUNDARIES. LONG-TERM STRATEGIC THINKING AND INTER-MUNICIPALITY COOPERATION MAY HELP THE REGION TO MITIGATE THE RISKS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISTRICT HEATING ENERGY SYSTEM. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

IN ADDITION TO THE THREE ASPECTS OF PROMOTING ACCESS, RENEWABLES, AND EFFICIENCY, THE DIMENSION OF RESILIENCE IN ENERGY SYSTEMS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDERED. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RESILIENT ENERGY SYSTEMS REQUIRES A QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PRACTICES UNDERLYING SUCH SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY, IN LINE WITH THE INCREASING GLOBALIZATION OF TRADE, THERE REMAINS A CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP ON THE LINK BETWEEN EMBODIED ENERGY IN THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF TRADED GOODS. TO BRIDGE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE INVESTIGATE THE RESILIENCE OF GLOBAL ENERGY SYSTEMS THROUGH AN EXAMINATION OF A DIVERSITY MEASURE OF GLOBAL EMBODIED ELECTRICITY TRADE BASED ON MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (MRIO) NETWORKS. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS RESEARCH LIES IN ITS ABILITY TO UTILIZE HIGH RESOLUTION MRIO DATA SETS IN ASSESSING THE RESILIENCE OF NATIONAL ENERGY SYSTEMS. THIS RESEARCH INDICATES THAT SECURE AND RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION REQUIRES THE DIVERSIFICATION OF NOT ONLY ENERGY GENERATION BUT ALSO ENERGY IMPORTS.

THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (DHS) IDENTIFIES A LIST OF 16 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS (CIS) WHOSE INCAPACITY DUE TO DISRUPTIONS WOULD HAVE A DEBILITATING IMPACT ON THE NATION'S ECONOMY. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF INTERDEPENDENCIES AMONG CIS ON THE RESILIENCE OF THE US ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. WE DEVELOP A-FRAMEWORK THAT COMBINES THE EMPIRICAL ECONOMIC INPUT-OUTPUT (EIO) MODEL WITH GRAPH THEORY BASED TECHNIQUES FOR UNDERSTANDING INTERDEPENDENCIES, INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND RESILIENCE IN THE US ECONOMIC SYSTEM. BY REPRESENTING THE US ECONOMY AS A NETWORK, WE ARE ABLE TO ANALYZE ITS TOPOLOGY BY SEPARATELY LOOKING AT ITS UNWEIGHTED AND WEIGHTED FORMS. TOPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE US EIO NETWORK SUGGESTS THAT IT EXHIBITS SMALL WORLD PROPERTIES FOR THE UNWEIGHTED CASE, AND IN THE WEIGHTED CASE, THE THROUGHPUT OF INDUSTRY SECTORS FOLLOWS A POWER-LAW WITH AN EXPONENTIAL CUTOFF. IMPLICATIONS OF THESE TOPOLOGICAL PROPERTIES ARE DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER. WE ALSO SIMULATE HYPOTHETICAL DISRUPTIONS ON CIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY INDUSTRIAL SECTORS THAT EXPERIENCE THE LARGEST ECONOMIC IMPACTS, AND TO QUANTIFY SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITY IN ECONOMIC TERMS. IN ADDITION, INSIGHTS FROM COMMUNITY DETECTION AND HYPOTHETICAL DISRUPTION SCENARIOS HELP ASSESS VULNERABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITIES TO DISRUPTIONS ON INDIVIDUAL CIS. THESE METHODOLOGIES ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHTS REGARDING THE EXTENT OF COUPLING BETWEEN EACH CIS IN THE US EIO NETWORK. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE OBSERVE THAT EXCESSIVE INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND INTERDEPENDENCIES OF CIS RESULTS IN HIGH SYSTEMIC VULNERABILITY. THIS INFORMATION CAN GUIDE POLICYMAKERS TO DESIGN POLICIES THAT IMPROVE RESILIENCE OF ECONOMIC NETWORKS, AND EVALUATE POLICIES THAT MIGHT INDIRECTLY INCREASE COUPLING BETWEEN CIS.

THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO QUANTIFY THIS CASCADING EFFECT TRIGGERED BY DISRUPTED TRANSPORTATION IN HUNAN PROVINCE DUE TO THE GREAT 2008 CHINESE ICE STORM AND PROPOSES OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES. THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM (CGE) MODEL (REFLECTING INDIRECT AND INDUCED EFFECTS AND THE NONLINEARITY OF PRODUCTION BLOCK) MAKES IT A PROMISING MODEL TO SIMULATE CASCADING EFFECTS AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES. A DETAIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS CONSTRUCTED IN THE PRODUCTION PART OF STANDARD CGE MODEL. THIS STUDY FINDS THE FOLLOWING RESULTS: THE ECONOMIC LOSS OF HUNAN PROVINCE IS AMPLIFIED BY APPROXIMATELY 40 TIMES BY CASCADING EFFECTS DURING THE 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DISASTER. LARGE-SCALE DISASTERS INDUCE MORE STRONG CASCADING EFFECTS THAN MINOR ONES. POST-DISASTER SYSTEM RESILIENCE EFFECTIVELY STOPS THE SPREAD OF CASCADING EFFECTS. WHEN THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM RESILIENCE (E. G., IMPROVING THE SUBSTITUTION BETWEEN ROAD TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND EFFICIENCY OF ROAD TRANSPORTATION) IS INCREASED BY 10 \%, THE ECONOMIC LOSSES INDUCED BY CASCADING EFFECTS CAN BE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 60 \%.

HOWEVER, ITS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IS UNCLEAR. ADAPTATION HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY URGENT IN A CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING CLIMATE, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF CLIMATE-CHANGE-RELATED DAMAGES. ON THE BASIS OF A BRIEF REVIEW OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION LITERATURE, WE SUGGEST THAT IE CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FOLLOWING TWO ASPECTS. FIRST, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE, IE CAN HELP US DETERMINE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE INTERACTS WITH OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND HOW THE INTERACTIONS MAY AGGRAVATE (OR MODERATE) ITS DIRECT IMPACTS OR WHETHER THEY MAY SHIFT BURDEN TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. SECOND, IE METHODOLOGIES CAN HELP US QUANTIFY THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES, IDENTIFY MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE ADAPTATION. FURTHER, WE FIND THAT SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE (E.G., TRANSPORT, ENERGY, AND WATER SUPPLY) AND AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. BECAUSE THESE SECTORS ARE ALSO THE MAIN DRIVERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, HOW TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE CLIMATE-RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DESERVES SPECIAL ATTENTION IN FUTURE IE STUDIES.
