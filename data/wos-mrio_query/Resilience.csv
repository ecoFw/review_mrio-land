THE MODEL COMPUTES THE IMPACTS OF RANDOM ENERGY PRODUCTION DISRUPTIONS ON THE ENTIRE MULTI-REGION INPUT-OUTPUT SYSTEM IN THE FORM OF FINAL DEMAND DEFICITS. WE THEN PROPOSE A FORMULATION TO EVALUATE THE ENERGY RESILIENCE OF THE SYSTEM BASED ON COMPUTING THE LARGEST SET OF DISRUPTIONS, OR WHAT IS TERMED AS RESILIENCE GUARANTEE LEVELS, THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED BY THE SYSTEM WITHIN GIVEN DEMAND DEFICIT BUDGETS. A COMPUTATIONAL STUDY IS THEN PERFORMED USING A 3-REGION-42-SECTOR MODEL BASED ON CHINA'S 2012 MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT TABLE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT REGIONAL TRADE BARRIERS, COAL-TO-GAS SWITCH POLICIES AND TECHNOLOGICAL EFFICIENCY OF SELECTED ENERGY-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES CAN INFLUENCE CHINA'S ENERGY RESILIENCE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS CAN PROVIDE THE POLICY-MAKERS IMPORTANT GUIDANCE ON IMPROVING ENERGY RESILIENCE IN A SYSTEMATIC MANNER. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER B.V. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

THE RESILIENCE OR THE ABILITY OF THE CRITICAL SECTOR TO RECOVER QUICKLY FROM THE DISRUPTION CAN ALSO REDUCE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISASTER. IN THIS PAPER, THROUGH RESILIENCE AND RECOVERY TIME DYNAMIC INOPERABILITY INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL (DIIM) IS APPLIED. THUS, INPUT-OUTPUT (I-O) TABLE IS CONSTRUCTED FOR PAKISTAN'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND A CASE STUDY IS PERFORMED ON THE FLOODING IN PAKISTAN 2011-12. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO PROVIDE A BALLPARK ESTIMATE OF THE SYSTEM-WIDE IMPACT AND RIPPLE EFFECT ON THE SECTORS THAT LASTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE DISRUPTION. FURTHERMORE, TO ANALYZE THE INOPERABILITY AND ECONOMIC LOSS IN THE SECTORS CAUSED BY THE DISASTER IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY. THE FINDINGS OF THE RESEARCH SHOW THAT MOST OF THE CRITICAL SECTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE SECTOR IN TERMS OF INOPERABILITY AND ECONOMIC LOSS RESPECTIVELY. THE OUTCOME OF THE STUDY WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR THE POLICY MAKERS, DISASTER MANAGEMENT AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO RESPOND ACCORDINGLY.",""

MODEL RESULTS INDICATE THAT RURAL REGIONS ARE MORE RESISTANT TO RECESSIONARY SHOCKS THAN URBAN REGIONS. THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPACE-SPECIFIC ABILITY OF SECTORS TO WITHSTAND ECONOMIC SHOCKS PORTRAYED THE RESILIENCE OF AGRICULTURE, WHILE FOOD INDUSTRY, ALTHOUGH ITS IMPACT OVERTIME DECLINED, MANAGED TO INCREASE ITS EMPLOYMENT IN SEVEN OUT OF THIRTEEN REGIONS. THE TOURISM SECTOR CONTRACTED BUT SHOWED MORE RESILIENCE IN THE ISLAND REGIONS THAN IN THE CONTINENTAL REGIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF CURRENT RESEARCH FOCUSES ON URBAN OR COMMUNITY ASSET SYSTEMS. TO PROVIDE A FULLY INTEGRATED APPROACH, ONE NEEDS TO DELINEATE THE FOCUS OF ASSET MANAGEMENT AT A CATCHMENT SCALE, TO INCLUDE THE NATURAL CAPITAL. THE RESEARCH DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER INTRODUCES SUCH AN APPROACH, WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT (E-RIO) ANALYSIS AT ITS CORE. THE NOVELTY OF THE WORK IS THE CONCEPTUALISATION OF A CATCHMENT AS A COMPLEX ASSET SYSTEM, COMPRISING OF MULTIPLE SUBSYSTEMS. THIS EXPANDS THE APPLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL MODELLING TECHNIQUES IN INTEGRATED CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AND WATER ACCOUNTING. THE CATCHMENT METABOLISM MODELLING SCHEMA CREATED IN THIS PAPER SERVES ASSET, WATER RESOURCES AND CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE SCHEMA FORMS THE GROUNDS FOR STRUCTURED COLLABORATION AMONG EXPERTS FOR INTEGRATED WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND DECISION-MAKING. IN THIS PAPER THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE MODELLING SCHEMA ALONG WITH THE TECHNIQUES USED ARE PRESENTED. ALIVE' INDUSTRIAL EXAMPLE FROM THE UK WATER SECTOR (POOLE HARBOUR CATCHMENT) IS USED TO DEMONSTRATE ITS APPLICATION. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.

THE EVOLUTION OF THOSE SYSTEMS HAS BEEN STUDIED THROUGH A VARIETY OF CONCEPTS (INCLUDING CENTRAL PLACE THEORY, URBAN `METABOLISM', ETC.). NEW FRAMEWORKS ON TELECONNECTIONS HAVE SYNTHESIZED AND EXTENDED PAST THEORY, BUT THE RELEVANCE OF THE TYPE, DEGREE AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE INTERLINKAGES FOR THE RESILIENCE OF URBAN SYSTEMS IS UNDERSTUDIED. WE EXPLORE THE EVOLVING NATURE OF THE INTERLINKAGES OF CITIES, RESOURCE BASES AND RESILIENCE USING TWO APPROACHES: (1) WE REVIEW LITERATURE ON URBAN SYSTEMS, TELECONNECTIONS AND RESILIENCE AND (2) WE DEVELOP SCENARIOS OF A STYLIZED NETWORK OF URBAN SESS AND EXAMINE THE SYSTEM-LEVEL RESILIENCE OF EACH SCENARIO TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS USING A MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY MODEL. OUR RESULTS SHOW HOW FACTORS SUCH AS RESOURCE CONSUMPTION, EXTRACTION AND POPULATION MIGRATION DRIVE SYSTEM-WIDE RESILIENCE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF TELECONNECTION OF URBAN SYSTEMS.",""

WHEN CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM IN A BROAD SENSE, THE ASSESSMENT OF TECHNICAL DEPENDENCIES AMONG ENGINEERED SYSTEMS CAN BE SUPPORTED BY THE ANALYSIS OF ECONOMICAL RELATIONSHIPS. A KEY TOOL TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE IS TO EXPLOIT THE INPUT- OUTPUT APPROACH PROPOSED BY WASSILY LEONTIEF FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF AN ECONOMY. RECENTLY, THE INPUT- OUTPUT APPROACH WAS EFFECTIVELY EXPLOITED TO ASSESS THE RESILIENCE OF ECONOMIES AGAINST CRITICAL EVENTS THAT MAY AFFECT SOME SECTORS AND RIPPLE THROUGH NEIGHBORING ECONOMIC SEGMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF THEIR VULNERABILITY, INERTIA, AND CENTRALITY TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY. BUILDING ON AN EXISTING APPROACH, THIS PAPER CONSIDERS A DYNAMIC INOPERABILITY INPUT- OUTPUT MODEL WITH INVENTORIES, EXAMINED ACCORDING TO THEIR ABILITY TO ENSURE EXTENDED SERVICE CONTINUITY DESPITE THE INOPERABILITY OF SOME SECTORS. REFERRING TO THIS MODEL, THE AUTHORS FIRST INTRODUCE A METHOD FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE RESILIENCE PARAMETER DESCRIBING THE ELASTICITY OF THE SECTORS WITH RESPECT TO SERVICE PERTURBATIONS.

AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER IS THE INCORPORATION OF INDUSTRY SECTORS' PREFERENCES IN ALLOCATING LIMITED PRODUCTS/SERVICES BETWEEN FINAL DOMESTIC DEMAND, FOREIGN FINAL DEMAND, AND INTERMEDIATE INDUSTRIES. THIS PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR ESTIMATING SOME OF THE INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF DISASTERS. THE PAPER ALSO CONSIDERS RECOVERY OPERATIONS WITHIN DISRUPTED SECTORS, FROM THE STANDPOINT OF EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMY DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD AFTER A DISASTER.

THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO QUANTIFY THIS CASCADING EFFECT TRIGGERED BY DISRUPTED TRANSPORTATION IN HUNAN PROVINCE DUE TO THE GREAT 2008 CHINESE ICE STORM AND PROPOSES OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES. THE ADVANTAGE OF COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM (CGE) MODEL (REFLECTING INDIRECT AND INDUCED EFFECTS AND THE NONLINEARITY OF PRODUCTION BLOCK) MAKES IT A PROMISING MODEL TO SIMULATE CASCADING EFFECTS AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF RISK MANAGEMENT MEASURES. A DETAIL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS CONSTRUCTED IN THE PRODUCTION PART OF STANDARD CGE MODEL. THIS STUDY FINDS THE FOLLOWING RESULTS: THE ECONOMIC LOSS OF HUNAN PROVINCE IS AMPLIFIED BY APPROXIMATELY 40 TIMES BY CASCADING EFFECTS DURING THE 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE DISASTER. LARGE-SCALE DISASTERS INDUCE MORE STRONG CASCADING EFFECTS THAN MINOR ONES. POST-DISASTER SYSTEM RESILIENCE EFFECTIVELY STOPS THE SPREAD OF CASCADING EFFECTS. WHEN THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM RESILIENCE (E. G., IMPROVING THE SUBSTITUTION BETWEEN ROAD TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION AND EFFICIENCY OF ROAD TRANSPORTATION) IS INCREASED BY 10 \%, THE ECONOMIC LOSSES INDUCED BY CASCADING EFFECTS CAN BE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 60 \%. OVERALL, IMPROVING POST-DISASTER SYSTEM RESILIENCE IS A HIGHLY EFFICIENT AND CHEAP MEASURE TO REDUCE THE RISK FROM CASCADING EFFECTS.",""

THE FOUNDATION OF THE METHODOLOGY IS A COMBINATION OF DEMAND-DRIVEN AND SUPPLY-DRIVEN INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSES. RESILIENCE IS INCLUDED THROUGH A SERIES OF AD HOC ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON VARIOUS FORMAL MODELS AND EXPERT JUDGMENT. MOREOVER, WE HAVE DESIGNED THE METHODOLOGY IN A MANNER THAT OVERCOMES THE MAJOR SHORTCOMINGS OF THE SUPPLY-DRIVEN APPROACH. WE APPLY THE METHODOLOGY TO A 90-DAY DISRUPTION AT THE TWIN SEAPORTS OF BEAUMONT AND PORT ARTHUR, TEXAS, WHICH IS A MAJOR PORT AREA THAT INCLUDES A PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING COMPLEX. WE FIND THAT REGIONAL GROSS OUTPUT COULD DECLINE BY AS MUCH AS \$13BILLION AT THE PORT REGION LEVEL, BUT THAT RESILIENCE CAN REDUCE THESE IMPACTS BY NEARLY 70\%.",""

THIS PAPER FOCUSES PARTICULARLY ON WORKFORCE DISRUPTIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANES. WE EXTEND THE DYNAMIC INOPERABILITY INPUT-OUTPUT MODEL (DIIM) BY FORMULATING A WORKFORCE RECOVERY MODEL TO IDENTIFY CRITICAL INDUSTRY SECTORS. A DECISION ANALYSIS TOOL IS UTILIZED BY INTEGRATING THE ECONOMIC LOSS AND INOPERABILITY METRICS TO STUDY THE INTERDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF VARIOUS HURRICANE INTENSITIES ON VIRGINIA'S WORKFORCE SECTORS. THE EXTENDED DIIM AND AVAILABLE WORKFORCE SURVEY DATA ARE INCORPORATED IN THE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL TO SIMULATE VARIOUS HURRICANE SCENARIOS. FOR A LOW-INTENSITY HURRICANE SCENARIO, THE SIMULATED TOTAL ECONOMIC LOSS TO VIRGINIA'S INDUSTRY SECTORS DUE TO WORKFORCE ABSENTEEISM IS AROUND \$410 MILLION. EXAMPLES OF CRITICAL SECTORS THAT SUFFER THE HIGHEST LOSSES FOR THIS SCENARIO INCLUDE: (1) MISCELLANEOUS PROFESSIONAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND TECHNICAL SERVICES; (2) FEDERAL GENERAL GOVERNMENT; (3) STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES; (4) CONSTRUCTION; AND (5) ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS PAPER ALSO EXPLORES THE INOPERABILITY METRIC, WHICH DESCRIBES THE PROPORTION IN WHICH A SECTOR CAPACITY IS DISRUPTED. THE INOPERABILITY METRIC REVEALS A DIFFERENT RANKING OF CRITICAL SECTORS, SUCH AS: (1) SOCIAL ASSISTANCE; (2) HOSPITALS AND NURSING AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES; (3) EDUCATIONAL SERVICES; (4) FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES; AND (5) FEDERAL GENERAL GOVERNMENT. RESULTS OF THE STUDY WILL HELP IDENTIFY THE CRITICAL WORKFORCE SECTORS AND CAN ULTIMATELY PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO FORMULATING PREPAREDNESS DECISIONS TO EXPEDITE DISASTER RECOVERY. THE MODEL WAS APPLIED TO THE STATE OF VIRGINIA BUT CAN BE GENERALIZED TO OTHER REGIONS AND OTHER DISASTER SCENARIOS.",""

THE ABILITY OF PROJECT DELIVERY TO RESIST AND RECOVER FROM DISRUPTIONS IS A MEASURE OF THE RESILIENCE OF THE PROCESS, WHICH CAN BE QUANTIFIED THROUGH A PROPOSED METRIC CALLED THE TENDENCY TOWARD INOPERABILITY (TI). THIS QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO RESILIENCE MEASUREMENT IS DEVELOPED BASED ON EXISTING INOPERABILITY INPUT-OUTPUT MODELS (IIM) AND MEASURES RESILIENCE AS THE CHANGE IN THE TI METRIC VALUE BEFORE AND AFTER RECOVERY MEASURES ARE EXECUTED. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE SHOWS HOW THE PROPOSED APPROACH CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE PROJECT DELIVERY RESILIENCE FOR A WASTEWATER FACILITY UPGRADE PROJECT. THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW METRIC THAT CAN QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE RESILIENCE IN THE PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS AND INTEGRATION OF THE RESILIENCE METRIC WITH THE IIM-BASED APPROACH TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF DISRUPTIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT PROJECT DELIVERY PHASES.

HOWEVER, ITS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IS UNCLEAR. ADAPTATION HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY URGENT IN A CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING CLIMATE, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF CLIMATE-CHANGE-RELATED DAMAGES. ON THE BASIS OF A BRIEF REVIEW OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION LITERATURE, WE SUGGEST THAT IE CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE FOLLOWING TWO ASPECTS. FIRST, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON A SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE, IE CAN HELP US DETERMINE HOW CLIMATE CHANGE INTERACTS WITH OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND HOW THE INTERACTIONS MAY AGGRAVATE (OR MODERATE) ITS DIRECT IMPACTS OR WHETHER THEY MAY SHIFT BURDEN TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. SECOND, IE METHODOLOGIES CAN HELP US QUANTIFY THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES, IDENTIFY MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES, AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE ADAPTATION. FURTHER, WE FIND THAT SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE (E.G., TRANSPORT, ENERGY, AND WATER SUPPLY) AND AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. BECAUSE THESE SECTORS ARE ALSO THE MAIN DRIVERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, HOW TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE CLIMATE-RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DESERVES SPECIAL ATTENTION IN FUTURE IE STUDIES. OVERALL, IE THINKING AND METHODOLOGIES HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION RESEARCH AND POLICY QUESTIONS, AND EXPLORING THIS GROWING FIELD WILL, IN TURN, INSPIRE IE DEVELOPMENT.",""
