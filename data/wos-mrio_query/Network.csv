HOWEVER, THE CURRENT SECTOR POLICIES FOCUS EITHER ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE OR CONSUMPTION WHILE THE MAJORITY OF SECTORS ALONG THE TRANSMISSION WERE OVERLOOKED. THIS RESEARCH COMBINES INPUT-OUTPUT MODELLING AND NETWORK ANALYSIS TO TRACK THE EMBODIED CARBON EMISSIONS AMONG THIRTY SECTORS OF THIRTY PROVINCES IN CHINA. BASED ON THE LARGE-DATA RESOLUTION NETWORK, A TWO-STEP NETWORK REDUCTION ALGORITHM IS USED TO EXTRACT THE BACKBONE OF THE NETWORK. IN ADDITION, NETWORK CENTRALITY METRICS AND COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHMS ARE USED TO ASSESS EACH INDIVIDUAL SECTOR'S ROLES, AND TO REVEAL THE CARBON COMMUNITIES WHERE SECTORS HAVE INTENSIVE EMISSION LINKS. THE RESEARCH RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SECTORS WITH HIGH OUT-DEGREE, IN-DEGREE OR BETWEENNESS CAN ACT AS LEVERAGE POINTS FOR CARBON EMISSIONS MITIGATION. IN ADDITION TO THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL ETS, THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT THE METALLURGY AND CONSTRUCTION SECTORS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION FROM NATIONAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. HOWEVER, THE HOTPOTS ARE DIFFERENT ACROSS PROVINCES AND THUS PROVINCIAL SPECIFIC TARGETED POLICIES SHOULD BE FORMED. MOREOVER, THERE ARE NINETEEN CARBON COMMUNITIES IN CHINA WITH DIFFERENT FEATURES, WHICH PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS' EXTERNAL COLLABORATION FOR SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS.",""

IDENTIFYING CHINA'S ENERGY CONSUMPTION PATHWAYS AT SECTORAL LEVELS PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION TO SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS, REDUCE TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ADDRESS ISSUES OF ACCESS AND EQUITY. THIS STUDY EVALUATES CHINA'S ENERGY FOOTPRINT BASED ON MULTI-REGIONAL INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS AT SECTORAL LEVEL FROM 1995 TO 2009. THE FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC DEPENDENCY OF CHINA'S ENERGY FOOTPRINT IS INVESTIGATED AT SECTORAL LEVEL AS WELL. THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF CHINA'S ENERGY FOOTPRINT TO THE TOTAL GLOBAL ENERGY FOOTPRINT INCREASED FROM 7.6\% IN 1995 TO 15.2\% IN 2009. CHINA'S SECTOR C18, WHICH RELATES TO THE SALE OF MOTOR VEHICLES, MOTORCYCLES AND FUEL, IS THE TOP ENERGY CONSUMING SECTOR OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. AT A SUB-SECTORAL LEVEL, THE DOMINANT ENERGY PATHWAY CONTRIBUTING TO C18 IS CHINA'S SUB-SECTORAL C17 (ENERGY SUPPLY SECTOR); C8 (ENERGY REFINED SECTOR); C12 (METAL SECTOR); C11 (OTHER NON-METALLIC MINERAL SECTOR); KOREA'S SECTORAL C9 (CHEMICAL SECTOR) AND C8 (ENERGY REFINED SECTOR) AND RUSSIA'S SECTORAL C17 (ENERGY SUPPLY SECTOR). IN TERMS OF DEPENDENCY ON OTHER COUNTRIES, CHINA'S ENERGY FOOTPRINT NETWORK DEPENDS MOST ON RUSSIA, USA AND GERMANY. (C) 2019 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",""

HERE, WE INVESTIGATE HOW 18 ECOLOGICAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (ENA) INDICATORS THAT CHARACTERIZE ECOSYSTEM GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, AND CONDITION ARE AFFECTED BY UNCERTAINTY IN AN ECOSYSTEM MODEL OF LAKE SIDNEY LANIER (USA). WE APPLIED ENA TO 122 PLAUSIBLE PARAMETERIZATIONS OF THE ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPED BY BORRETT AND OSIDELE (2007, ECOLOGICAL MODELLING 200, 371-387), AND THEN USED THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV) TO COMPARE SYSTEM INDICATOR VARIABILITY. WE CONSIDERED TOTAL SYSTEM THROUGHPUT (TST) AS A MEASURE OF THE UNDERLYING MODEL UNCERTAINTY AND TESTED THREE HYPOTHESES. FIRST, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT NON-RATIO INDICATORS WHOSE CALCULATION INCLUDES THE TST WOULD BE AT LEAST AS VARIABLE AS TST IF NOT MORE VARIABLE. SECOND, WE POSTULATED THAT INDICATORS CALCULATED AS RATIOS, WITH TST IN THE NUMERATOR AND DENOMINATOR WOULD TEND TO BE LESS VARIABLE THAN TST BECAUSE ITS INFLUENCE WILL CANCEL. LAST, WE EXPECTED THE AVERAGE MUTUAL INFORMATION (AMI) TO BE LESS VARIABLE THAN TST BECAUSE IT IS A BOUNDED FUNCTION. OUR WORK SHOWS THAT THE 18 INDICATORS GROUPED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES. THE FIRST GROUP HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER CVS THAN THE CV FOR TST. IN THIS GROUP, MODEL UNCERTAINTY IS AMPLIFIED RENDERING THESE THREE INDICATORS LESS USEFUL. THE SECOND GROUP OF FOUR INDICATORS SHOWS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN VARIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO TST. FINALLY, THERE ARE TWO GROUPS WHOSE CV VALUES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT FOR TST. THE LEAST VARIABLE GROUP INCLUDES THE RATIO-BASED INDICATORS AND AVERAGE MUTUAL INFORMATION.
